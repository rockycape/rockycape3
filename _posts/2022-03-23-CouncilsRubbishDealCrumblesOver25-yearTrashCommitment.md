A plan to process the rubbish from 15 local government areas in Melbourne's south-east is on the brink of implosion after the councils, which are pushing households to reduce their weekly garbage, were asked to commit to minimum levels of waste for the next 25 years.

The councils set up the South East Metropolitan Advanced Waste Processing company to process their household rubbish in new facilities.

But the deal -- and the company -- could be doomed after eight councils rejected the proposal or put their decisions on hold.

Glen Eira mayor Jim McGee said it seemed hypocritical to enter a long-term contract that required councils to guarantee the amount of waste they would produce while they were at the same time asking householders to reduce the waste that was going to landfill.

"It seemed to be a contradiction in the message we were giving our community talking about diverting from landfill but entering a 25-year contract with a minimum amount of rubbish we had to provide," he said. "It just didn't stack up in the end."

Cr McGee said a "Plan B" was needed to divert rubbish from landfill now that councils had pulled out of the deal.

"The tips out the eastern side of town are closing; they are only four years from closing and all that rubbish will have to go across the West Gate [Bridge]," he said. "We are taking this responsibility on when the state government is reaping hundreds of millions of dollars from the waste levy and doing nothing with it."

One of the most contentious aspects of the proposed deal is the prospect that some waste will be incinerated at a waste-to-energy plant, which will burn rubbish at high temperatures to convert it into electricity.

At the time of the deal's creation, the state government's Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Group said new facilities would attract multimillion-dollar investment and create up to 400 jobs during construction and 100 permanent jobs.

However, eight councils have either rejected the deal outright or put a decision on hold, placing the project in jeopardy.

Boroondara, Glen Eira, Manningham and Monash councils have all rejected the deal.

*The Age* understands Maroondah and Stonnington have also pulled out, but the councils did not respond to a request for comment.

Frankston City Council has delayed its decision. Last week, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council expressed concerns about the deal. It voted against committing to it and to defer any further decision for at least three months.

Port Phillip Council has also rejected the deal, but it was never part of the procurement process.

Bayside, Cardinia, Casey, Kingston, Knox, Whitehorse and Yarra Ranges councils are all signed up to the deal.

Mr Cummins said advanced waste-processing facilities were being used safely and reliably around the world.

"Modern, best-practice facilities have strong safety track records and are designed to meet strict emissions standards," he said.

State Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the government was working with councils to ensure they had the resources to deliver waste and recycling reforms.

"We've invested more than $127 million to support councils' rollout [of] Victoria's four-bin system including purchasing new bins, improving drop-off facilities, delivering education campaigns and ensuring they have the infrastructure in place to roll out our waste reforms," she said.

"We're tackling the challenges facing the recycling industry -- our unprecedented investment is minimising the amount of waste we produce and ensuring we're recycling as many items as possible."
