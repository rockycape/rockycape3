More than a million used printer cartridges are being stockpiled and will not be recycled until next year after a warehouse fire at a recycling facility brought the industry to a standstill.

The used printer cartridges are collected for recycling by a program managed in part by environmental charity Planet Ark, which relied on the Melbourne-based Close the Loop facility.

Emergency authorities attended the recycling facility in Melbourne's north in June following reports of a fire.

But a fire five months ago damaged the facility, leading to a collapse of its recycling effort which was also relied on by REDcycle - a scheme supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths used to recycle soft plastic that was billed as [Australia's largest plastic bag recycling program.](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5bw9q)

Now it can be revealed one of the largest printer recycling schemes has also been caught up, leaving 1.1 million cartridges in storage.

The "Cartridges 4 Planet Ark" recycling scheme has been running since 2003, in a collaboration between Planet Ark and participating manufacturers Brother, Canon, Cartridge World, Epson, HP and Kyocera.

A box printer cartridges are put into for collection.

Since the fire in June, Close the Loop has been storing the cartridges collected in the Cartridges 4 Planet Ark program until recycling capacity is back online, a Planet Ark spokesperson told *The Sydney Morning Herald *and *The Age. *

"Cartridges will continue to be collected and safely stored until the plant reopens, which is expected to be mid 2023," the spokesperson said.

"Close the Loop is the only cartridge recycling processor in Australia with a zero waste to landfill capability proven over many years of operation. This zero waste to landfill promise remains the environmental commitment of the Cartridges 4 Planet Ark program."

Since the program's inception, Planet Ark said a total of 51.7 million cartridges have been collected and of this total 50.6 million have been recycled with zero waste to landfill.

The spokesperson advised consumers to continue recycling their printer cartridges as normal.

Close the Loop chief executive officer Joe Foster said he expected the facility to be up and running "within the next few months".

"We took immediate action at the time of the fire to keep taking cartridges in. We check them in, sort and send back to the original equipment manufacturer, harvest for parts and then recycle into plastics and metals as the last resort," he said.

Foster added that Planet Ark was just one program that the company recycled for.

"The business was built on the brand promise of zero waste to landfill and have been practising this for the past 21 years," he said.

Meanwhile, consumers looking to recycle their soft plastics have been told to dump their bags in the bin after the same factory fire led to the [suspension of the REDcycle soft plastic recycling scheme in nearly 2000 supermarket outlets across the country. ](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5bw9q)

The announcement came amid revelations the company responsible for running the scheme had been stockpiling -- not recycling -- hundreds of millions of bags and other soft plastic items over the past five months.

It was the only program in the country that invited consumers to drop off shopping bags, pet food bags, ice-cream wrappers, bubble wrap and frozen food packaging for recycling. Its failure has been met with calls for urgent intervention in the recycling industry by government figures.

Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said on Wednesday the problems facing the recycling program were "unfortunate".

REDcycle, which collects five million plastic items a day or 7000 tonnes a year, had become almost entirely dependent on Close the Loop to process its stock as the industry found it increasingly difficult to find financially viable methods of converting soft plastic into usable materials.

In the weeks after the blaze, Close the Loop announced to the market that its production line would be back up and running within six months. That would eventually be pushed back to mid-2023 as part of a larger expansion plan.
