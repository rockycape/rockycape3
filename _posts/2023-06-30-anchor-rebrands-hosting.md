US web and commerce technology firm Newfold Digital has acquired hosting services company Hostopia Australia from payments and business technology company Deluxe for an undisclosed sum.

The acquisition expands Newfold Digital's presence in Australia, while Hostopia Australia customers would gain access to Newfold's brands, products and customer support. Some of Newfold's brands include Web.com, CrazyDomains.com, Reseller Club and more.

Hostopia also brings in some 50,000 small business customers and 250,000 hosted websites.

"Newfold Digital's mission is centred on helping businesses of all sizes build and grow an online presence, so we are confident our Australia web hosting customers will be in good hands," Deluxe president of cloud solutions Garry Capers said.

"Throughout our ongoing transformation, Deluxe has concentrated our efforts on cross-selling our many platforms, solutions and services to our four million small business customers and more than 4000 enterprise and financial customers.

"To better manage our portfolio of businesses, and to emphasise our cross-sell abilities, it makes sense at this time to sell our Australia hosting operations to further refine our offerings in the North American market."

Newfold Digital president Ed Jay said the company was always looking to grow its footprint and bring Newfold's brands and products to small businesses around the world.

"A trusted web hosting service provider is essential for today's online businesses, and Deluxe's Australia web hosting business is an established platform," Jay said.

"We are excited to welcome their customers and employees as we build upon our previous acquisitions of CrazyDomains and FreeParking to further enhance our position in the region."

Newfold Digital is the result of the merger of Web.com and US-based Endurance Web Presence in February 2021. Prior to this move, Web.com had been active in the Australian mergers and acquisitions space.

In 2019, Web.com acquired [Australian hosting provider Dreamscape Networks](https://www.crn.com.au/news/webcom-to-acquire-aussie-hosting-firm-dreamscape-networks-for-105m-528639)for $105 million, expanding its presence in the country and adding the Crazy Domains and Vodien brands.

The following year, the company also [made a bid to acquire Webcentral Group](https://www.crn.com.au/news/arq-group-rebrands-to-webcentral-group-sold-to-webcom-for-12-million-550387)for $12 million, but was ultimately beaten by [Australian telco services company 5G Networks](https://www.crn.com.au/news/5g-networks-wins-webcentral-bidding-war-with-webcom-553509).

Digital Pacific has been acquired by the Australian arm of US company Deluxe Corp for $52 million as the consolidation of the local hosting sector continues at pace.

The acquisition was carried out in July by Hostopia Australia, the local arm of the wholesale web service provider owned by Deluxe. Digital Pacific is expected to bring in US$9 million to Deluxe this financial year.

As part of the transaction, Digital Pacific chief Andrew Koloadin has stepped down from his role, 18 years after founding the company, though he remains on the board of directors.

He was replaced by former Deluxe vice president of business services Tony Maiolo, whose resume includes positions in Australia, New Zealand and the US, including the Deluxe role as well as general manager of sales and operations at Melbourne IT.

Koloadin told CRN that he doesn't expect the acquisition to have an impact on day-to-day operations, and that staff would remain in place. He remains chief executive of data centre company Australian Pacific Data Centres, which is the co-location provider for Digital Pacific.

Both Hostopia and Digital Pacific have seen their share of acquisitions over the years -- the two coming under one roof creates one of the largest private hosting firms in the country.

Hostopia was acquired by Deluxe in 2008, helping the cheque printing services company get a foot in the hosting market. In 2017, Hostopia Australia [acquired Melbourne-headquartered hosting provider Panthur](https://www.crn.com.au/news/melbourne-hosting-provider-panthur-acquired-by-us-services-provider-457102).

On the Digital Pacific side, the company has acquired two Sydney-based hosting providers; [Crucial was acquired ](https://www.crn.com.au/news/crucial-sold-for-double-digit-millions-changes-ceo-406138)in July for "double-digit millions" and [Anchor Hosting was acquired](https://www.crn.com.au/news/web-hosting-provider-digital-pacific-acquires-managed-cloud-firm-anchor-461806) for an undisclosed amount, which brought over 100,000 new services internationally.
