Mike Cannon-Brookes, the billionaire co-founder of Atlassian, fired his family investment vehicle’s chief financial officer after accusing her of transferring money to his estranged wife, Annie Cannon-Brookes.

The couple separated almost two years ago and are in the midst of a messy fight as they split their assets after a 13-year marriage. The Financial Review Rich List estimates they have a combined fortune of $24.4 billion, making the Cannon-Brookes family the third wealthiest in the country.

The acrimony over the split of assets spilled into the public after Mike Cannon-Brookes sued a former employee of the family office, known as Cannon-Brookes Services, alleging they had attempted to transfer sensitive documents to his estranged wife and another former employee.

Documents filed with the Supreme Court of NSW and obtained by _AFR Weekend_ show that former employee Catherine Manuel was accused of transferring a “very significant” amount of money to Annie Cannon-Brookes without authorisation before she was sacked in November.

Since the separation, Annie Cannon-Brookes has started her own investment vehicle, known as Smart Collective, and attempted to hire staff from her former family office, which is controlled by Mike Cannon-Brookes. [Cannon-Brookes Services runs a number of investment and not-for-profit vehicles](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p59yat), including the Cannon-Brookes Foundation.

Manuel was the former chief financial officer of Cannon-Brookes Services and now works for Annie Cannon-Brookes at her new firm.

The Supreme Court filings show that Mike Cannon-Brookes not only accused Manuel of transferring money to Annie Cannon-Brookes without approval but also of directing some employees at Cannon-Brookes Services to work from Annie Cannon-Brookes’ new offices.

“Ms Manuel approved the transfer of a very significant amount of funds from a CBC account to Ms Cannon-Brookes, without the knowledge or approval of Ms Manuel’s then manager,” a letter from Cannon-Brookes Services reads.

The correspondence was filed in legal action taken against Kevin Chiu, the former company secretary of Cannon-Brookes Services. Chiu was accused of attempting to share almost 1000 documents about employees with Manuel and Annie Cannon-Brookes. Mike Cannon-Brookes successfully argued Chiu should hand over his devices so that the court could assess whether he was still in possession of the confidential information.

His barrister, John Fernon, SC, had told Supreme Court judge Kate Williams on Monday that he only did so on a request from Manuel, and he considered the act to be “in the normal course of his role” as company secretary.

But Cannon-Brookes’ barrister, Tim Breakspear, SC, said Manuel was terminated by the company over alleged “serious misconduct” four weeks before she requested the documents from Chiu.

Ultimately, Justice Williams found Chiu’s use of his personal Gmail account rather than the company email supported the argument “that these communications were not made in the ordinary course of his employment”.

“It is inherently improbable that those duties extended to sharing confidential information of the kind [that Chiu shared] with a person whose employment had recently been terminated,” Justice Williams added.

Annie purchased Paddington’s Bonython building – a short drive from Cannon-Brookes Services’ offices, which the couple bought for $18 million in 2020 – for $30 million last year as the base for Smart Collective’s office.

Along with a considerable stake in Atlassian, which Mike Cannon-Brookes co-founded with fellow billionaire entrepreneur Scott Farquhar in 2002, the family is a major investor in AGL Energy, an electricity company. [The family also has an extensive property portfoli](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5dqjh)o, including the Fairwater mansion in Point Piper, which was once owned by the Fairfax family and sold to the Cannon-Brookes’ for $100 million in 2018.

A decade ago, Annie Cannon-Brookes told _Collective Hub_: “He seems to think I’m better at reading the more subtle interactions between two people, so he’ll come to me to ask a question about employees.”

The Cannon-Brookes’ and Manual declined to comment.
