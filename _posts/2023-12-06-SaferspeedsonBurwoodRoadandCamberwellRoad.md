We've made Burwood Road and Camberwell Road safer for all road users as part of the Road Safety Program, delivered in partnership with the Australian Government and Victorian Government.   

About the project

To improve safety on Burwood Road and Camberwell Road for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, we've: 

-   introduced a safer 40km/h speed limit from 7am to 7pm, between the Church Street intersection on Burwood Road and the Harold Street intersection on Camberwell Road. 
-   installed electronic speed limit signs (ESLS) to ensure the speed change is clearly visible to motorists.

*** Project background ***

From December 2015 to December 2020, 48 crashes have occurred along this stretch of road, with 13 involving pedestrians and 23 resulting in people suffering serious injuries. 

A 40km/h speed limit will help reduce the likelihood and the severity of road crashes, improving safety for all road users.

This project is part of the Road Safety Program, delivered in partnership with the Australian Government and the Victorian Government to deliver safer, connected journeys in Victoria while supporting our economic recovery.

The Road Safety Program supports the fast roll-out of road safety treatments and promotes greater protection for vulnerable road users, like cyclists and pedestrians.
