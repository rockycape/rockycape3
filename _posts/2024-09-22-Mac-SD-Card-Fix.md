To reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on a Mac Mini, follow these steps based on the model and whether it has a T2 chip:

### For Intel-based Mac Mini (without T2 chip):

1.  **Shut down your Mac.**
2.  **Unplug the power cord** and wait for 15-20 seconds.
3.  **Plug the power cord back in.**
4.  Wait another 5 seconds, then **turn on your Mac** by pressing the power button.

### For Intel-based Mac Mini (with T2 chip):

1.  **Shut down your Mac.**
2.  **Hold the power button** for 10 seconds.
3.  Release the power button and wait a few seconds.
4.  **Turn on your Mac** by pressing the power button again.

### For M1 or newer Mac Mini:

The SMC reset process doesn't apply to M1 or newer Macs, as they manage power differently. If you're experiencing issues, restarting your Mac or shutting it down and waiting a few seconds before powering it back on typically resolves most problems.
