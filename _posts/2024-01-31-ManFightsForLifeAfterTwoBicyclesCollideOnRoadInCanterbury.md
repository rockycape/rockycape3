The other, a 62-year-old Blackburn man, sustained minor injuries and is also in hospital.

The two e-bikes collided at the bottom of a hill on the road and police believe the second rider was trying to overtake, which then caused the crash.

Witnesses told police there was no sign of aggression between the riders before the collision.

Police expect to interview the 62-year-old rider on Wednesday.
