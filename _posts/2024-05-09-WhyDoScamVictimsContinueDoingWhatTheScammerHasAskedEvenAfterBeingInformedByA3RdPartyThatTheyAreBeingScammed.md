If a scam victim is under the scammers influence of "coercion": 
- why does the victim try to do what the scammer has asked and then why does the victim sometimes continue even after being informed that they are being scammed?  


When a scam victim is under the influence of coercion, they may feel compelled to prove that they have done what was asked for several reasons:  

Fear of Consequences: Scammers often use threats or intimidation to coerce their victims into complying with their demands. Victims may fear that if they fail to provide proof of compliance, they will face negative consequences such as legal action, financial loss, or harm to themselves or their loved ones. By providing proof of compliance, victims may hope to avoid or mitigate these potential consequences.  

Desire to End the Situation: Victims may believe that by providing proof of compliance, they can satisfy the scammer's demands and bring an end to the stressful or threatening situation. They may hope that once the scammer has what they want, they will no longer be harassed or threatened.  

Sense of Obligation or Guilt: Scammers often manipulate their victims into feeling a sense of obligation or guilt, making them believe that they are responsible for the scammer's supposed plight or hardship. Victims may feel a moral or ethical duty to comply with the scammer's requests in order to help them or avoid further harm.  

False Sense of Trust: In some cases, victims may develop a false sense of trust or rapport with the scammer, particularly if the scammer has been able to establish a convincing persona or pretext. Victims may believe that by providing proof of compliance, they are building or maintaining a relationship of trust with the scammer.  

Hope for Resolution: Victims may hold out hope that by complying with the scammer's demands and providing proof of compliance, they can resolve the situation and recover any losses or damages incurred as a result of the scam. They may believe that cooperating with the scammer is the quickest or easiest way to achieve a resolution.  


Overall, the need to prove compliance with the scammer's demands stems from a combination of fear, obligation, trust, and the desire for resolution. Scammers exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate their victims into further compliance, perpetuating the cycle of coercion and exploitation. It's crucial to provide support and education to empower scam victims to recognize and resist manipulation tactics and to seek assistance from law enforcement or other authorities when needed.
