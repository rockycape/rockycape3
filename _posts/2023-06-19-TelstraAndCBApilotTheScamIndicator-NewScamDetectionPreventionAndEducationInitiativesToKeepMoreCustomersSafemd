## What is the Scam Indicator and how does it work?

The Scam Indicator is a pilot tool we developed alongside the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to help detect and prevent phone scams for joint customers. It uses a Telstra Application Programming Interface (API) that CBA integrates into its scam detection processes to identify high-risk scam situations in real time.  

The Scam Indicator enables CBA to confirm if a customer is on a phone call – a prime indicator that a scam is occurring. This allows CBA the opportunity to try to contact the customer or conduct additional checks to help protect customers from transferring large amounts of money to criminals. 

To protect the privacy of customers, CBA is only able to access specific data points relating to scam prevention through the API and does not have access to any contents of a communication or other underlying customer data.

Based on early simulations, the Scam Indicator has the potential to double the success rate of phone scam detection and prevention, which could save vulnerable Australians from being scammed collectively up to $15-20 million per year.

Currently running as a pilot, the Scam Indicator will launch to joint customers of CBA and Telstra in the coming months. 

### **How do I opt in to Scam Indicator?**

CBA customers with an active Telstra plan are automatically protected by the Scam Indicator and do not need to opt-in.

### **How do I opt out of Scam Indicator?**

If for whatever reason you no longer want to be protected by Scam Indicator while online banking (via both a web browser and the CBA mobile app), opting- out is simple:

1.  Using your Telstra phone, send a text message to **0407 102 173** with the words “OPT-OUT”
2.  You’ll receive a one-time passcode from Telstra to confirm you’re a real person
3.  Copy that one-time code and text it back to our Scam Indicator number (**0407 102 173**).
4.  We’ll send you a text message confirming you have opted out of Scam Indicator
5.  Alternatively, call us on 1800 298 608
