A controversial plan to ban the use of compostable plastic bags in household food waste bins has been trashed by its harshest critics. 



'Only Premier Allan and Labor would have a plan to ban biodegradable bags and force people to tip wet food scraps into brown paper bag, which will break,' he told the [Herald Sun](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/a-future-overhaul-could-of-the-states-waste-system-could-see-household-bins-impacted/news-story/9b7ca843408baec06087fd2c94655137).

Composting bags rated AS 4736 and AS 5810 are currently allowed in Victoria, but the Household Waste and Recycling Draft Service Standard -- 2024 could mean compostable bin bags will not be accepted in the green bins in future. 

Waste management company SECOS chief executive Richard Tegoni fears  households will have to deal with the smell and mess of handling their food waste by hand or with buckets

The proposed changes also impact other types of bins [used in Victoria](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11992423/Yellow-bin-rubbish-changes-Australia.html), such as banning plastic meat trays, frozen food cartons and all cordial bottles from being put into yellow bins.

A government spokesperson pointed out that people can have their say on the future of the state's waste management system.

'We're currently consulting on a draft Service Standard that sets out which items can be sorted into each of the four bins to reduce contamination and maximise the quantity of recycled materials that can be reused and turned into new products,' they said.

Submissions on the proposed changes close next week.
