Compostable tidy bags made from corn starch typically contain a blend of plant-based materials. The primary component is corn starch, which provides the biodegradable polymer base. In addition, these bags often include polylactic acid (PLA), derived from fermented plant sugars (like corn), and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), a biodegradable plastic that helps improve flexibility and strength. Some manufacturers also use non-toxic, water-based inks for printing on the bags. These materials are fully compostable, breaking down in both industrial and home composting environments.

 EcoflexÂ® (BASF, Germany) is a product name for PBAT. PBAT was first considered as a compostable biopolymer because polyesters are more susceptible to enzymatic degradation, such as by esterases.
