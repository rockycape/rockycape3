Company ceo Yi Kang-Myung is eager to take responsible battery recycling to new markets.

### SungEel HiTech has announced the opening of its first US battery recycling plant. The South Korean firm will invest more than US$ 37 million in the new site, which will be operated by its subsidiary SungEel Recycling Park Georgia, LLC.

The new battery recycling will be built in Stephens County, Texas, and create a total of 104 jobs. Operations are expected to begin in early 2024. This expansion follows SungEel's decision to acquire Australian firm [Envirostream](https://envirostream.com.au/lithium-australia-now-fully-owns-strategic-battery-recycling-asset-envirostream/) earlier this year.

'Our entry into Georgia is the last piece of the puzzle to help Georgia build a sustainable ecosystem of for its electric vehicle supply chain,' says Suk Jae Yim, representative of [SungEel's](https://www.sungeelht.com/en) US venture.

With more than 10 years of patented technology under its belt, SungEel specialises in complete recycling technology, allowing it to recover 95% of battery metals. These include include nickel, cobalt, and lithium. The recycler treats both end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scrap.

'Creating the jobs of the future and protecting resources means preparing key industries, such as the automotive industry, for the next technological revolution,' comments Pat Wilson, Stephens County Development Authority commissioner, during his meeting with SungEel in Korea this week.
