Can’t find your dream home? In Melbourne’s well-heeled inner east, one option is to buy out your neighbours – and build it.

The Verrocchi family, of Chemist Warehouse fame, have bought six adjacent houses in Toorak for a combined $22.83 million and secured a planning permit to build a new residence.

They’re not alone, as families with the means look to create homes that suit their needs rather than buying someone else’s vision.

Matthew and Nicole Verrocchi are set to demolish the existing mix of town residences and apartments to build their dream home. Matthew’s father is Mario, Chemist Warehouse co-founder, and Matthew is part of the empire as well as managing director of Bondi Perfume Co.

The first purchase was in 2017, a $5.78 million contemporary home in Toorak marketed with a butler’s pantry, barbecue and heated swimming pool. The selling agent was Marshall White’s Marcus Chiminello who could not be reached.

Their next buy the following year was the home of their next-door neighbour to the south for $2.4 million, also through Marshall White, described in its listing as an original Edwardian residence and opportunity for a new luxury home.

The couple spent another $2.4 million in 2022 on the next house to the south, a four-bedroom town residence with skylights, stainless-steel appliances and a rear courtyard, through Woodards South Yarra.

In 2023, they bought out the neighbour on the north side of their original purchase, paying $5 million, then in 2024, they added the next neighbour to the south side of their expanding footprint for $2.75 million.

Last year, they also spent $4.5 million on a property that backs onto their block.

Stonnington Council records show a planning permit has been issued to construct a building on the site.

Woodards South Yarra’s Luke Piccolo declined to comment on any aspect of the transaction he handled or the identity of the buyers when contacted.

But speaking generally, he said he had noticed a trend of site amalgamations in the inner east for families looking to build a new residence that suited their requirements. For example, some high-end buyers might desire wellness amenities such as a sauna, gym, pool, spa and cold plunge pool, but others might need to house a car collection.

He recently sold a block of apartments that is being consolidated into a single residence, another unit block that is being developed into a smaller number of luxury apartments, and four townhouses that were amalgamated.

“We are being asked by many of our clients to find them opportunities to take their destiny into their hands,” he said.

“For a family to find a large landholding in Stonnington, the options are very few.”
