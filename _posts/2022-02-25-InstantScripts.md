Anyone with even half an eye on their budget knows that the key to saving money is shopping around. 

But did you know that in Australia, bargain hunting can even extend to prescriptions? 

Although Australia is ranked as the 11th most affordable place to buy common prescription drugs in the world, prices can be vastly different, with some people paying upwards of $10 more for a repeat prescription just because they switched pharmacies. 

Healthcare gaps like this, and making access to health care easy for all Australians regardless of location, were the driving force behind Dr Asher Freilich creating online prescription provider [InstantScripts](https://www.instantscripts.com.au/). 

Dr Freilich, who quit his successful career in investment banker to study medicine and become a doctor, says the first spark of the idea for InstantScripts was ignited while he was working in Healthcare Mergers and Acquisitions. 

"I've always had an interest in how medical and healthcare solutions could be delivered to the public more efficiently and in a more cost-effective way," he says. 

But it was when he was working as a junior doctor and subsequently a GP, that he realised there was an urgent need for something to make healthcare more affordable for all Australians. 

"I noticed healthcare gaps and blind spots in our current healthcare system, which often leave vulnerable Australians excluded and unable to receive quality care," he explains. 

"We are becoming increasingly time poor, and I identified a strong need for short, focused healthcare interactions. For example, there are many who need to access prescription medications but cannot access their GP. I wanted to provide Australians with efficient, affordable and above all, accessible, healthcare."

**Disrupting medicine prices**

InstantScripts, which recently received over $10 million in funding, currently fulfils around 350,000 prescriptions a year nationwide. 

The online platform works by patients picking medication from categories including anti hypertensives, blood thinners and cholesterol on the Instant Scripts app, then answering a short questionnaire.

The results are sent to a GP to review and, if successful, a prescription is emailed to a pharmacy of the patient's choosing at a cost of $15. An original script is mailed out later.

Dr Freilich started InstantScripts with his own funds and, he says, "really bootstrapped the business".

"It has certainly been a labour of love and it was tough but satisfying to fund the business on my own at the beginning," he says. 

"We recently received nearly $11 million in funding from a consortium of investors, which will allow us to expand and grow our offering."

The platform, which has a predominantly female customer base and most commonly dispenses contraceptives, antidepressants (SSRIs) and Viagra, was met with resistance from the medical community when it first launched, but that's changing, says Dr Freilich. 

"I think across many industries, disrupters are often met with scepticism and weariness, and we were certainly met with this by the community," he explains. 

"However, over time GPs and healthcare professionals have come to realise that we aren't there to replace the valuable, hands-on service that the community offers. If anything, our service often reminds patients and customers to visit their GP more regularly."

**Prescription prices in Australia **

Under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Federal Government subsidises the cost of medicine in Australia, so that patients pay no more than $40.30. 

Even so, the prices for medicine can vary widely under this cap depending on where you live and what pharmacy you go to.

If you purchase a [high-level extras cover from an Australian private health fund](https://www.news.com.au/best-of/money/extrashealthinsurance/news-story/5d13a2be690e0485fe3da32b01ca167b), your policy will most likely include some cover for the cost of prescription medication. Extras policies typically only provide cover for prescription drugs that are not subsidised under the PBS.

Dr Freilich says "many factors' impact prescription pricing and points out that smaller pharmacies might not have the means to discount medicines in the same way as larger chains.

And when asked about how InstantScripts manages to keep its prescriptions to $15 -- a cost he describes as "very effective and competitive" -- he says it's because of its relationships with pharmacies across the country. 

"Rather than compete with pharmacies, we partner with them instead," he explains. 

"We have partnered with more than 3500 pharmacies across the country, which accounts for over half the pharmacies in Australia. However, we would love to see standardised pricing across the board."

# Ex-investment banker scores $11m after quitting to start a tech firm

A former Citi investment banker who gave up his corporate career to become a doctor, but instead tried his hand at entrepreneurship, has raised almost $11 million for his AI-enabled telehealth start-up, which gives people access to prescriptions quickly.

Launched by Dr Asher Freilich in late 2018, [InstantScripts](https://www.instantscripts.com.au/) offers patients two options to conduct the appointments necessary to get a prescription remotely.


The first is to engage via an express digital service for $15, which involves answering a set of questions generated by an AI bot, with the answers reviewed via text by a doctor, while the second is to pay $40 for a telehealth consultation with one of its 30 doctors in Australia.

In less than three years, the business has served more than 300,000 patients and has about 1000 interactions with patients each day.

Dr Freilich said he was inspired to start the business after seeing inefficiencies in the healthcare system while completing his GP training.

"There are many experiences that can be optimised and streamlined around the provision of routine healthcare services," he said.

"Often they can be streamlined in a safe and clinically responsible way without compromising patient safety.

"You can reduce redundancy, patient wait time and optimise GP time, so they're not spending most of their day issuing repeat prescriptions."

Dr Freilich studied medicine and finance, before becoming a healthcare investment banker with Citi in Sydney and then Piper Jaffray in New York.


After working as an investment banker for several years he said he "had an itch" to complete his residency training and become a fully qualified doctor.

While doing so Dr Freilich created his first telehealth business, setting up a company called Phonemed in 2011, which provided an injury management hotline to businesses.

He also set up a consumer telehealth business -- one of the first in the country -- and while running this he noticed most patients used the service to access routine prescriptions. This gave him the idea of creating a platform that merged artificial intelligence with human consultations.

"We get the computer platform to vet the patient and it really saves time and creates efficiencies," Dr Freilich said.

"[For things like] the contraceptive pill, or cholesterol tablets, or a routine anti-depressant, these things have a fairly prescriptive set of criteria that defines a patient's eligibility, and they lend themselves to an AI overlay, which reduces time.

"But, we are careful not to create a product that replaces the GP consultation completely. We have features that discourage chronic use, and we provide one-off courses of antibiotics, not repeats, if someone is using the express digital service."

About 80 per cent of InstantScripts' revenue comes from express appointments, while 20 per cent is from telehealth consultations.

The $10.9 million cash injection in InstantScripts was led by Perennial and will support the company's ongoing growth in Australia, as well as a US expansion in the next 12 months, which it will tackle state by state.

[Many telehealth start-ups have reported huge growth surges that may never have happened if it weren't for the COVID-19](https://www.afr.com/technology/telehealth-start-ups-hail-a-decade-s-worth-of-progress-during-covid-19-20200603-p54z4b) pandemic last year, but Dr Freilich said InstantScripts had already been growing strongly.

"We're not a product of COVID," he said. "We didn't jump on the bandwagon.

"COVID actually presented some challenges to the business because Medicare got involved. For the briefest time the eligibility criteria was broadened to include services like ours ... so I had to employ 20 new GPs to come and absorb the live consulting volume.

"But now we're not eligible again."

Now, telehealth consults are eligible for Medicare only if the patient has had an in-person consultation with the doctor in the previous 12 months.

Dr Freilich said it was a good proof point for the business that people were willing to pay for the service, but he believed that for certain groups, including young people and those living in regional Australia, services like InstantScripts should have continued to be eligible for Medicare.

"A lot of our users are in late adolescence or in regional Australia and [in these cases] it's not as easy as Medicare might think to have a regular physical relationship with a doctor," he said.

"I understand what they're trying to achieve, they don't want to make physical GPs an endangered species, but there was a more nuanced way to go about it."
