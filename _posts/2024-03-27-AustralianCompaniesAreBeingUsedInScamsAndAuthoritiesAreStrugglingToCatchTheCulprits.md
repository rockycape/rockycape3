- **In short:** Legitimately registered Australian companies are being used to allegedly shift scam victims’ money overseas and the directors are not being prosecuted.
- One financial crime expert says “the vast majority” of investment scam crimes are using shell companies to create plausible deniability.
- **What’s next?** Scam victim Jo O'Brien is trying to sue a company allegedly linked to the disappearance of her funds, in the hope she'll get some money back.

When the boss of a small security firm appeared wearing a makeshift disguise — a surgical mask over his face, aviator sunnies to hide his eyes and an oversized hoodie — it was clear this wasn't going to be a routine interview.

The ABC had arranged to speak with Muhammad Ali Waheed, the director of a company we'd been investigating, over Zoom because he said he was in the Middle East.

"Hello, can you hear me?" he asked, the comical disguise the elephant in the virtual room, as the connection slowly established.

![A screenshot of Muhammad Ali Waheed in a video call.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/72896a955b648278eea0efb95abf5a9b?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=590&cropW=590&xPos=667&yPos=429&width=862&height=862)

Mr Waheed owns a Victorian company, Supercheap Security, that is facing serious allegations.

Victoria police say nine scam victims have reported losing almost $1.7 million after paying Supercheap Security.

In April 2022, the company opened a bank account, which was then allegedly used to shift most of the scam victims' money out of the country.

A big chunk of those lost funds belonged to Jo O'Brien, who sent $500,000 from a divorce settlement.

In June 2022, on the cusp of rebuilding her life, she wanted to invest her funds and thought she had found a secure long-term deposit account managed by financial giant AMP.

"I was thinking I'm moving forward, I'm doing the right thing and it was going to be peachy from here," she said.

But the "AMP advisors" she was speaking to were scammers who tricked her into sending the money into an Australian bank account before the funds disappeared offshore.

"My money was gone," she said.

Ms O'Brien only found out something was wrong when she got a call from her bank — the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), later that month.

The phone call where Jo O'Brien found out she might have been scammed.

Her funds landed in a business account with the National Australia Bank (NAB).

Frantic, she rushed to a NAB branch in Melbourne's Collins Street and was shocked by what they said.

"[The NAB teller said] the account was not in my name, it was in the name of some security company. He said 'I probably shouldn't tell you this, however, I can see that over the last few weeks … millions of dollars have come in and out, and the money's gone straight overseas'."

**Do you know more about Australian companies allegedly being used to move stolen funds?**

**Email [Specialist.Team@abc.net.au](mailto:Specialist.Team@abc.net.au)**

The bank account was in the name of Supercheap Security.

When Ms O'Brien first found out it belonged to a registered company, with an easily identifiable Australian-based director, she began to breathe a little easier, thinking at least the matter would be a cut-and-dried case for authorities.

She was wrong.

Her story demonstrates just how hard it is for law enforcement to establish who's to blame in scam cases involving companies and it raises concerns about how firms are monitored and regulated.

## Supercheap Security a 'sham' company

Neil Jeans, a former police detective who helped investigate the 'Wolf of Wall Street' Jordan Belfort, says stories like Ms O'Brien's are just the "tip of the iceberg".

"The vast majority of these crimes use companies," he said.

Mr Jeans is now a partner at consulting firm Grant Thornton.

He's raised concerns about Australian companies being used to launder stolen funds with few serious consequences.

"The reason they use companies is because that creates distance from the individuals and creates this reasonable doubt and this plausible deniability."

Despite Ms O'Brien and other victims reporting their losses to police, no one has been successfully prosecuted.

Supercheap Security remains registered with the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC).

"I just can't understand how people can register companies with ASIC in Australia and be involved in this sort of [alleged] criminal activity without consequences," Ms O'Brien said.

Scam victims, including Ms O'Brien, are suing Supercheap Security, claiming it was used to defraud them.

The company was registered by an Australian-based Pakistani man, Hassan Mehdi, in 2021 and its officially listed business address is a suburban home in regional Victoria.

Supercheap Security's website is no longer online.

"There's no evidence that there was ever a legitimate business … it appears that it was simply a shell company opened for the purposes of creating a bank account," Ms O'Brien's lawyer, Mark Carmody, said.

Banks also have strict obligations to properly identify customers and conduct additional verification checks.

Ms O'Brien unsuccessfully tried suing NAB, arguing they'd failed in their legal obligations when they didn't recognise and stop the dodgy transactions.

While the case against the bank failed, it did provide a wealth of new information.

"My lawyer had to subpoena the bank statement … we got all the details of who owned the account and where they lived," she said.

Still reeling and at a loss for what to do, Ms O'Brien made a dangerous move.

## A super cheap company, a house call and an airport arrest

After she discovered the address of Supercheap Security, she got into her car alone in early August 2022, and drove over to the suburban house to try to confront company founder Hassan Mehdi.

"I thought, well, I'm not going to sit at home and cry," she said.

The man who first answered the door said he had never heard of the company but when she pressed for answers, he sent another man out to face her questions.

The second man said Mr Mehdi wouldn't be home for a week and asked for her phone number.

Ms O'Brien said she swore at him and marched back to her car.

The next thing she heard, Mr Mehdi had been arrested trying to leave the country.

"I got a phone call from my lawyer saying … he was intercepted at Tullamarine airport … and they put him in jail," she said.

![Hassan Medhi pictured next to his car in his garage.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cf483b6c4ac8047fa9ac3a686a62c6d7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=872&cropW=1308&xPos=55&yPos=7&width=862&height=575)

In 2022 Hassan Mehdi was charged with eight counts of obtaining property by deception.(ABC News)

Mr Mehdi was charged with eight counts of obtaining property by deception, in connection with the scam.

He denied any involvement in the investment scam or the money transfers and police later dropped the charges against him, insisting they did so on legal advice.

In a statement police said:

> "Victoria Police has progressed available information on alleged offending overseas with foreign partners through the Australian Federal Police – INTERPOL Bureau," the statement said.
> 
> "Should further information come to light on crimes committed in Victoria, the investigation can be reopened."

The challenge for police appears to be the question of who was actually in charge of the company's bank account at the time of the scam and whether they were in Australia.

Mr Mehdi maintains he sold the company and control of the bank account to his friend, Muhammad Ali Waheed, in May 2022, just before the bank account was used by the scammers, therefore absolving him of any involvement.

But documents obtained by the ABC show ASIC wasn't advised Mr Mehdi had resigned until three months later.

The documents sent to ASIC in August 2022 included a handwritten letter by Mr Mehdi, saying he had resigned and "as of 18/05/22 I would not be liable for anything to do with this company".

![A hand-written note says 'due to my personal circumstances, I would like to resign as director/secretary of Supercheap Security'](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/49867c93755780e11cd067d67e9a6096?src)

A hand-written note from Hassan Mehdi to the 'directors' of Supercheap Security. At the time of writing, he was the sole listed director.

Ms O'Brien believes her house call may have tipped off Mr Medhi that the allegations of stolen money being moved through the company account had been found out.

"I went to [the] house … then a couple of weeks later, Hassan Mehdi goes to the ASIC website and backdates his directorship to May," Ms O'Brien said.

The ABC called Mr Mehdi, and in a brief conversation, he maintained he had nothing to do with the scam.

"If I would have done it, I would have not been here mate [in Australia], I would've not been here," he said.

Ongoing civil legal proceedings allege Supercheap Security was a sham company.

When asked if Supercheap Security was a shell company, Mr Mehdi said:

"I don't know. Let me talk to my lawyer, and then I'll get back to you or ring you later because you are asking me the questions like you are a bloody police or something."

He told us he sold about $1,000 worth of security equipment through the company.

He provided no evidence to back up this claim, but he does own another security company, called Click Security, that has an active Facebook page and customers who have confirmed they have used its services.

## The business opportunity that needed an Australian bank account

It was a Friday evening, Australian time, when the out-of-focus man claiming to be Muhammad Ali Waheed, appeared on the screen.

Mr Waheed told us he took over Supercheap Security in May 2022, describing it as a "spare" company belonging to his friend, Mr Mehdi.

He said he'd previously been a "labour guy", working in kitchens and warehouses.

Muhammad Ali Waheed answers the ABC's questions about the alleged scam.

Mr Waheed said he took over Supercheap Security because an acquaintance in Dubai told him he was starting a business selling tech products in Australia, and needed a local company "with a good reputation" and a bank account.

"I was just blindly trusting him because he owns millions of dollars … of property in Dubai," he said.

"I was the one who was giving him all the credentials and all the account details, and he has a guy in Sydney who was operating the account."

Mr Waheed said he received $13,000 for providing the account details.

He acknowledged he'd broken the law by allowing the account to be used the way it was, but said at the time he had no idea.

"If I ever had a small hint [that this was a] scam. I would never do it," he said.

He promised to forward screenshots of a Whatsapp conversation, between himself and the Dubai man called Usman, that would prove his claims.

But the messages Mr Waheed forwarded, which begin in April 2022, don't include any mention of a tech sales company or any clues as to what business Mr Waheed thought he was facilitating.

They do show Usman asking for details of bank accounts and one time passwords.

![WhatsApp screenshot shows Usman asking "any update for lease and accounts" and Waheed replying with a photo of an NAB branch..](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/50cf6a917cea0afcaa903da5bbcedcb6?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=764&cropW=430&xPos=0&yPos=83&width=862&height=1533)

When Usman asks for an update on the "lease and accounts", Mr Waheed (in green) replies with pictures from an NAB branch.

In another screenshot, Usman asks "bro can we use that nab account" — "for tomorrow".

Usman appeared to ask about how large the account limit is for NAB.

![A screenshot of a WhatsApp conversation showing someone sending through NAB bank details.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/641f595907226cb5c3ac1b21c8968300?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=764&cropW=430&xPos=0&yPos=83&width=862&height=1533)

In this screenshot, Mr Waheed sends the chat the log-in details for an NAB account.

Many of Mr Waheed's responses are voice messages, making it difficult to understand and verify his involvement.

But they show Usman asking for "any updates" on the account and Mr Waheed sending photos from an NAB branch and an email from the bank addressed to Hassan saying "we've received your application" to open a business account.

The ABC cannot independently verify the screenshots but they appear to feature authentic bank login details and information that can be linked to Supercheap's NAB account.

"Accounts has (sic) been applied as i have sent you login for nab, the remaining process is from the bank, once they generate the account I'll let you know," Mr Waheed wrote on April 22, 2022.

Messages sent by Usman to Mr Waheed in early May, show him constantly pushing for quick access:

> "Bro can we use that nab account."

> "For tomorrow"

> "If we need otp [one time passcode] Your guy will give us?"

Soon afterwards, in mid-May, scam victims' money began flowing in and out of the account.

Mr Waheed agreed to a follow-up phone call with the ABC to explain the messages, but pulled out saying he had a sore throat.

In an email, he said:

"Usman was is (sic) the culprit he asked me for company with account i used my contacts in Australia and got him one he did not waste the time and had the scam done asap thats (sic) about the timing. I had no involvement in it," he wrote.

He told the ABC he offered to repay the scam victims $500,000, later explaining in an email why he could easily afford such an amount:

"$1m might be a big amount for you but not for my family we are pretty well off people … I just don't want any criminal charges against me. I am not a criminal."

## Who owned Supercheap Security when it was being used by scammers?

While it's alleged the bank account of Supercheap Security was used to shift huge amounts of scam victims' money offshore, what's unclear is who was individually responsible.

Financial crime expert Neil Jeans said cases like these were particularly challenging for authorities.

"They take a lot of resources and they take a lot of effort, particularly if you're trying to chase money overseas and you're trying to prove that beyond reasonable doubt," he said.

"Most of those fraud cases really only become successful if you have somebody telling you what they did and why they did it."

Complicating matters is the question of when exactly Mr Waheed took over the reins of the company.

Mr Waheed claimed he was to blame for Mr Mehdi's three-month-late resignation because he had failed to lodge the ASIC paperwork.

Pushed about whether he had made up a story to absolve his Australian-based friend Hassan Mehdi, Mr Waheed denied this was the case.

"I think Hassan already had enough proof to get himself out of this [and have criminal charges dropped]."

The ABC sent detailed questions to Mr Mehdi and his law firm including about the contents of the Whatsapp messages.

Over Zoom, Mr Waheed said he had not been approached by authorities, but was willing to be interviewed by police.

A promise to pass on Usman's contact details was never fulfilled.

In a follow-up email he told the ABC he would share them with police.

"I will be lauching (sic) a formal complaint to Vic police including AFP and i shall give them all that information … i suggest you should stick to your domain instead of trying to be a detective," Mr Waheed wrote.

The ABC could not independently verify Mr Waheed’s claims.

## Authorities, industry scrambling to keep up with scammers

Back in Australia, Ms O'Brien vividly remembers the despair of learning her money was gone.

"[The bank's representative] asked me, did I want the phone number for Lifeline? And I actually felt sorry for him because he sounded far too young and unprepared to be ringing customers up and giving them that sort of information," she said.

"I pulled off the next exit … I cried my eyes out for quite a long time … it's probably the worst moment of my life."

Jo O'Brien calls to raise her account transfer limit.

Adding insult to injury is the fact that if this scam occurred one year later, Ms O'Brien might have never lost her money.

In March 2023 CBA introduced name and account matching technology, which warns customers if they have the wrong account name when transferring money.

Like other victims who sent money to Supercheap Security, Ms O'Brien wrote a completely different account name when she made the transaction.

In 2022, her bank did not notify her of the discrepancy — but today it would.

"When I see the little prompt come up, you know, 'the name doesn't match' and I think, well where was that?" she said.

"That makes me angry."

Many Australian banks still don't have name and account matching technology.

She's seeking reimbursement and has lodged a dispute against the bank with the financial ombudsman AFCA.

In response to a series of questions about CBA's handling of Ms O'Brien's case, the bank spokesperson said it was "actively engaging in the AFCA complaint process".

Her civil case against NAB revealed that in the two months the Supercheap account was active, NAB allowed large sums to be sent through the account and offshore, mostly to the UK.

She claims the bank was too slow to act and money continued to leave the account after she warned the branch in June 2022.

"Another $275,000 had come in and out of that same account, so it wasn't shut down immediately," Ms O'Brien said.

Senior NAB executive Chris Sheehan defended the bank, saying investigating company accounts can be a slow and complex process.

"It can take some time to understand exactly where that money has come from, how much of it is legitimate money and how much of it is illegal," Mr Sheehan, NAB's Executive Group Investigations & Fraud said.

Pressed about whether there were transfers from the business account 24 to 48 hours after Ms O'Brien's warning he said "it's possible there were".

The case ultimately failed, with the judge finding there was no way she could successfully argue NAB knew the Supercheap Security account was fraudulent.

In a statement, the regulator ASIC said suspicious activities involving bank accounts were monitored by AUSTRAC, and that Supercheap Security had "maintained the administrative requirements to remain registered."

Jo O'Brien is still hopeful she will get some of her funds back through civil action against the company.(ABC News: Loretta Florance)

Ms O'Brien says the public needs better protection.

"I think the system has failed us … something needs to be done, because this has to stop," she said.

"The banks need to be accountable. They need much better security systems in place and the laws need to change and protect the average Australian because at the moment they protect the banks and it's not right."

Frustrated with the system that she says let her down, Ms O'Brien hasn't given up her fight to recoup her funds.

"Now, I'm going down the path of trying to bankrupt [Hassan Medhi] and it's taken so long and it's very stressful," she said.

"I just feel like I'm doing the job of the bank."
