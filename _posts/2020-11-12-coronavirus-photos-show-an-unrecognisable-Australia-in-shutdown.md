Empty desks on the ground floor of the State Library Victoria dome reading room.*(ABC News: Margaret Burin)*none

These grand shelves are the guardians of endless stories that have shaped us.

The balconies are filled with historic parliamentary papers, documenting decisions that have changed the country we live in and who we are.

![A view of empty desks and rows of bookshelves from above in the dome reading room.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e0d3210f229460162541c95df865d0f7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1988&cropW=2648&xPos=94&yPos=0&width=862&height=647)

Australian libraries are among the many public places closed to help stop the spread of Coronavirus.*(ABC News: Margaret Burin)*none

War and famine.

Depression and oppression.

Gold and rebellion.

A stolen generation. A sorry.

One day, these same walls will house images just like these --- the history we're living right now.

![Empty steps leading up to the Sydney Opera House](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f56c11ac6cf32ac938a1453d0a039828?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1558&cropW=2335&xPos=82&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)

The unusual sight of empty steps leading up to the Sydney Opera House.*(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)*none

Spaces that are normally packed with people, with life, lying dormant.

Our cities as ghost towns, our future uncertain.

A time when life must be put on hold.

The crisp damp grass of the MCG means it's footy season.

Normally.

On a Friday evening like this, as the sun disappears behind the light towers, the most eager fans would begin finding their seats in the stands, a beer in one hand and a pie in the other.

But these are far from normal times.

![The sun goes down behind the Melbourne Cricket Ground light towers and city buildings](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/eab28959a2009e37e180406dd31730c0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1980&cropW=2649&xPos=188&yPos=0&width=862&height=647)

The sun goes down behind the Melbourne Cricket Ground stands, which will remain empty until restrictions on large public gatherings are lifted.*(ABC News: Margaret Burin)*none

The sight of the 100,000-capacity space is unnerving.

Yes, the seats are empty most days of the week.

But even when it's not game-day, there'd be clattering from catering trolleys, beeping from buggies, and the buzz of excited tourists experiencing 'the G' for the first time.

There'd be planes flying overhead, and the horns of peak-hour traffic building up on one of Melbourne's busiest roads.

It's the kind of commotion you don't even know you're hearing until it's gone.

But the sight of these empty seats brings the crashing realisation that even when life does start to return to normal, the idea of this number of people gathering in one space again anytime soon is unfathomable.

![Lines of empty green seats fill the frame](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9b5b7a83d64392abaf84601c2b855000?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2000&cropW=2666&xPos=167&yPos=0&width=862&height=647)

The MCG is one of the world's largest sports stadiums.*(ABC News: Margaret Burin)*none

It's the longest the seats in this stadium have been denied the energy, the roaring melody of sports fans, since Australian and US troops occupied the grounds during World War II.

For now this giant place sleeps, and no-one knows when it will wake again.

But it's not just the MCG.

Right across the country, familiar scenes --- our streets, our shops, airports and playgrounds --- are eerily unfamiliar without us in them.

A lone traveller walks along an empty pick-up bay rank at Melbourne Airport, normally packed with cars, taxis and people at this time of the evening.*(ABC News: Margaret Burin)*none

Our ancestors lived through the world wars, and the Great Depression.

This is different. Incomparable.

The Humpty Doo Hotel would usually be starting to get busy with tourists at this time of year, as visitors flock to Kakadu for the Northern Territory dry season.*(ABC News: Hamish Harty)*none

We're being asked to stay at home, not be away for years fighting in the trenches.

But this crisis has been likened to war on two fronts --- fighting a pandemic that threatens an unknown number of lives, and the battle to protect the economy and livelihoods.

![Festival lights hang above an empty beer garden at Hotel Brunswick](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/15f6e298bbcf7d60406413b09a961fd1?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2001&cropW=2668&xPos=166&yPos=0&width=862&height=647)

The beer garden of Hotel Brunswick on the New South Wales north coast is usually packed on a Friday evening.*(ABC News: Catherine Marciniak)*none

After weeks of being shut down, the Hotel Brunswick is padlocked, the taps are shut down and the stage is gathering dust.*(ABC News: Catherine Marciniak)*none

Life as we know it has turned into something we thought only existed in far-fetched Hollywood thrillers.

Restaurants in Sydney's Chinatown are filled with boxes of newly ordered takeaway plastic containers as workers are surrounded by empty chairs.*(ABC News: Mridula Amin)*none

An empty classroom at St Leonards Primary School in Launceston, where the majority of children are currently being schooled remotely.*(ABC News: Fred Hooper)*none

And schools are unnaturally quiet.

Instead, most parents are helping their children learn at home.

Many of us can't see family, distancing ourselves from those we hold dearest.

Our walking tracks are busier than ever, as we escape our new realities of staying at home all day, every day.

Some of us are leading much slower lives.

Some more manic ones.

Others don't have the luxury of self-isolation in a safe, warm home.Â 

There's no doubt this pandemic will go down in our history books.

We just don't know how the story will end.

But like the battles that fill our history books, the time we're living through right now will change us forever.
