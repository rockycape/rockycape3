![69 Broadway, Camberwell - for herald sun real estate](https://www.realestate.com.au/news-image/w_1280,h_720/v1740682939/news-lifestyle-content-assets/wp-content/production/capi_dc3965e838de79e90bb11b6ce234673b_7533ba889057df43198e9a12ed759f6e_997428d0de7.jpeg?_i=AA)

The Camberwell house was built in the early 1900s.

**A couple who are part of the ultra-wealthy Verrocchi family of Chemist Warehouse fame have listed a sprawling Camberwell property with a $11.5m-$12.65m asking price.**

Wife and husband Joanne and Marcello Verrocchi have put their circa-1901 house, featuring a 15m-long lap pool and tennis court, on the market.

Kay & Burton Boroondara’s Walter Dodich declined to comment on the owners but public records show it is held in Ms Verrocchi’s name.

The five-bedroom home is set to become one of Camberwell’s most expensive residences – the suburb’s current $13m house price record was set by 35 Prospect Hill Rd last year.

In 2022, Mr and Ms Verrocchi [splashed $19.5m on a mansion](https://www.realestate.com.au/news/hotly-contested-sale-of-131yearold-mansion-owned-by-autobarn-cofounder/?campaignType=external&campaignChannel=syndication&campaignName=ncacont&campaignContent=&campaignSource=herald_sun&campaignPlacement=article "www.realestate.com.au") at [16 Harcourt St, Hawthorn East,](https://www.realestate.com.au/sold/property-house-vic-hawthorn+east-140089559 "www.realestate.com.au") that was previously owned by the family of late Autobarn co-founder Garry Dumbrell.

Mr Dodich said that the Camberwell abode’s landscaped gardens were among the best he has ever seen.

“It’s very much a resort-style property, at an expansive 3267sq m it’s pretty rare to find that sort of holding in Boroondara,” he said.

A highlight of the outdoor area is a pool house with a kitchenette, speaker system, bathroom and sauna.

There’s also a bluestone-paved terrace fitted with a retractable awning and barbecue.

Designed by noted Melbourne architects Beverley Ussher and Henry Kemp, the residence is part of a Boroondara Council heritage-listed precinct where several Victorian- and Federation-era houses are located.

Visitors to the impressive pad are greeted by a three-tier water fountain and the house’s Hawthorn brick facade framed by a tessellated veranda.

An entrance hall with a high ceiling, marble tiling and parquetry flooring leads to a formal lounge and dining rooms, each with mansard ceilings and open fireplaces.

In the kitchen, there are a range of Gaggenau appliances; including a deep fryer, gas cooktop and steamer, an integrated Miele dishwasher, a breakfast bench and soft-close cabinetry.

The gardens are kept green thanks to an underground bore, a 50,000L rainwater tank and a desalination system.

The renovated main bedroom suite showcases a walk-in wardrobe, wool carpets and an ensuite featuring a freestanding bath, dual Villeroy & Boch vanity and frameless shower.

Elsewhere there’s a study, powder rooms, hydronic heating, airconditioning and a garage.

Council-approved plans for a basement and rear extension are available for interested buyers.

“It is a unique home and it’s very rare to get a listing like this,” Mr Dodich said.

He is expecting both local and international buyer interest, including families.
