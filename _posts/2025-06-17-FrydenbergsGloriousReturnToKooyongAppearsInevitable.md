The former treasurer has the chess pieces in place to insert himself back into federal politics.

Re-drawing of boundaries ahead of the 2025 federal election meant shifting electorates for some of Melbourne’s wealthiest suburbs. Gone was Higgins (once held by Peter Costello and Kelly O’Dwyer). The neighbouring Kooyong swallowed up the moneyed residents of Toorak, Malvern and Armadale.

The Liberals held their first meeting of the amalgamated Kooyong and Higgins FEC (federal electorate conference) at Malvern Town Hall on Monday night.

For a party on its knees, what a turn-out! There were more than 440 members who showed up for the new super-sized Kooyong FEC. They included former Victorian Liberal leader (and Malvern MP) Michael O’Brien, and state members for Kew and Prahran Jess Wilson and Rachel Westaway. Legislative council member (and failed preselection candidate for Kew) David Davis was also there, as was Hawthorn MP and ex-state leader John Pesutto, whose tussle with Moira Deeming could bankrupt him.

Would you believe Josh Frydenberg was also there? The man who famously lost Kooyong is now ensconced as local chairman at Goldman Sachs. No one believes he’s let go of his political ambitions (because he hasn’t). The events at the freezing Malvern Town Hall make a return to politics almost seem inevitable.

Attendees were there to elect a new executive. The top role of chair was stitched up beforehand, with Jacqueline Blackwell replacing the outgoing former Boroondara Council mayor Phillip Healy.

Both Blackwell and Healy are big backers of Frydenberg. The former is married to Richard Murray, the retail executive who was poached from JB Hi-Fi by Solly Lew to be CEO of Premier Investments in 2021. Murray rather abruptly stepped down in 2023 and jumped to Metcash’s Total Tools. Last week, he quietly departed when Total Tools was merged with Mitre10, the company’s other hardware brand.

Murray also once ran the Higgins 200 club, which raised money for local candidates for years. Now that Higgins is no more, we’re told the activities have been picked up by other groups.

Party machine man
But with Blackwell running the Kooyong party machine, Frydenberg has the chairman of selectors on side. In fact, up and down the ticket his allies and friends ran the board.

Membership officer went to Ben Jessop, while Justin Bergman was named treasurer, and both are allied to Frydenberg. James Damches was put on the general committee. He’s workedwith Keith Wolahan, the recently-ousted federal Liberal moderate MP, and Jane Hume, who was dumped from shadow cabinet. One member said Damches considers himself a chance running in the seat.

The secretary position went to Josh Worth, who used to work for Frydenberg and is now a staffer for Jess Wilson. Wilson replaced Tim Smith as the state MP for Kew after he shuffled from politics after drink-driving his car into a fence. In a mad turn of events, Smith’s political ambitions have gone global. He’s currently a senior adviser to Israel’s deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel. Smith must be doing great! Israel’s run of deft diplomacy means a two-state solution is looking as likely as a Victorian Liberal government.

None of it bodes well for Amelia Hamer, the most recently defeated candidate for Kooyong who this column last saw in a coffee shop loudly talking about her desire to capitalise on the “momentum” of her campaign. It has been stopped as abruptly as Smith’s fence-ramming Jaguar.

Hamer was there at the Town Hall. There was talk that she was considering a run for the chair position. That idea was abandoned as Frydenberg’s praetorian guard closed ranks.

It’s funny that these were the same people pushing Hamer as the “future of the Liberal party” only two months ago. One member said the takeaway of Tim Wilson re-taking Goldstein at the recent election was that “white men” can win in Melbourne. Never change.

There’s an old joke about Victorian builders aligned with the CFMEU: if it’s raining they have the day off, if it’s too hot they can’t work, and if the conditions are fine, they’ll take a rostered-day off so they can take the family to the beach.
