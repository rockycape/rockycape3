A historic Canterbury home wrecked in an arson attack is set to be rebuilt after what has been described as a "landmark" council ruling.

Boroondara Council voted unanimously on Monday night to order the rebuilding of Shenley Croft on Mangarra Rd by anyone who wants to develop the site in future.

The heritage-listed home was destroyed on December 9 by a blaze which remains the subject of a criminal investigation.

The council will now approach Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny to have Boroondara's planning scheme amended so that any future development of the $6 million site will include the rebuilding of Shenley Croft.

The council's resolution said section 6B of the Planning and Environment Act "provides that a planning permit must not be granted for the redevelopment of land on which there is or was a heritage building other than the reconstruction and reinstatement or repair of a heritage building."

Tarni James, whose family lived in Shenley Croft for 60 years, hailed the council vote as a "landmark" decision.

Her mother Merle, who died in 2020 at age 98, taught hundreds of people to dance in her studio over many decades.

"I am immensely grateful for the message this resolution sends. There are now extremely serious repercussions in place," Ms James said.

Cr Felicity Sinfield, who moved the Shenley Croft motion, said it was a magnificent property nestled in Canterbury's Golden Mile.

"Tonight we sent a really strong message that the fabric of our city is worth protecting, worth preserving, and worth reinstating so that we can continue to be the most liveable city in Victoria," Cr Sinfield said on Instagram.

"I thank the Council officers for the actions they have taken to address this loss of heritage, for their research and diligence in bringing to us a strategy that has not previously been tested in Victoria, to leverage the Minister's powers to restore 7 Mangarra Rd, Canterbury."

Local Federal MP Monique Ryan has written to Ms Kilkenny urging her to make the planning scheme amendment.

"The property is of local historical and aesthetic significance. It is held dear by many local residents," Dr Ryan wrote.

No charges have been laid over the Shenley Croft fire.

Boroondara CIU investigators have been looking for the driver of a white utility seen at the property in the period the blaze was started.
