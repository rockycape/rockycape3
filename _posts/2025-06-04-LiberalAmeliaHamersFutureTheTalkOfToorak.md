Last Friday, the failed Liberal party candidate for Kooyong, Amelia Hamer, met with two associates at Brothers Keeper. They were prominently perched near a window of the café on Glenferrie Road in Kooyong (the suburb, not the electorate), which is a favourite of some of the area's more prominent residents.

Packaging billionaire Raphael Geminder is frequently spotted grabbing his morning brew from Brothers Keeper. CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, lives around the corner.

It wasn't just the fact of Hamer showing her face at the well-connected café after the election. One spy overheard some of the group's idle chatter, which included griping about how she copped stray criticism for her hair.

Also, Hamer, in her own words, wanted to "capitalise on the momentum" of the campaign. It is hardly that of a freight train, but she did cut into Teal Monique Ryan's vote in the former Liberal stronghold: she got a 1.5 per cent swing. Tim Wilson in neighbouring Goldstein nabbed 3.3 per cent.

So while Hamer couldn't capitalise on her lineage (as grand-niece of former Victorian premier Sir Rupert "Dick" Hamer), and was exposed as the country's funniest "renter" (with two investment properties in her back pocket), she is a Millennial and apparently undeterred by getting towelled up in the national media.

Hamer is also capitalising on another fact: the Liberal party is in such a dire state, it needs people like her. The non-crazy sort. Candidates whose main source of truth isn't Sky News after 7 pm.

There's already one story floated in the local press about her being sounded out about running in the state election next year. Considering the Victorian Liberals’ current orgy of self-harm, she isn't that stupid, is she? We hear she's told friends she won't be running for the state seat of Hawthorn.

There's also the possibility she wants to hang around to run for Kooyong again in three years’ time.

There's no shortage of locals who could help her out so she could continue campaigning. Former JB Hi-Fi and Premier Investments CEO Richard Murray was said to have been helping her on the fundraiser circuit.

Even trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox had a "Hamer 4 Kooyong" sign on his mansion's walls. Fox was a friend of Sir Rupert, while his granddaughter also went to Toorak's favourite St Catherine's with Amelia.

The spectre lingering over Hamer's future is Josh Frydenberg. If there's one man who thinks the future of the Liberals isn't so much Hamer-shaped, but rather involves the glorious return of the bald former Kooyong MP, it's the man himself.
