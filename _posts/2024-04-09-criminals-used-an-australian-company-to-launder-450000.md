With his retirement growing closer, Peter Correy decided to make a boring but safe investment.

He wanted to invest in Treasury bonds and use the proceeds to fund a laid-back beach lifestyle on the NSW Central Coast with his wife Michelle.

After using an online investment comparison website he was contacted by someone claiming to be from the Swiss investment bank UBS.

The "representative" helped broker a deal, and Mr Correy believed he was buying bonds from an established Australian company, Newtech Industrial Group.

But after depositing $450,000 into Newtech's bank account in April and May 2022, Mr Correy became suspicious.

It turned out he had not been speaking with UBS, but a scammer impersonating the Swiss bank.

Mr Correy also discovered that Newtech had transferred some of his money offshore, without his knowledge.

"Emotionally I was just absolutely gutted," he said.

Even though he had been conned, many of the details involved were real.

Newtech Industrial Group was a real company that had been registered in Australia since 2007. The bank account he sent his money to was their real bank account. And the account was with a real bank: the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

This is the second example uncovered by the ABC of an Australian company's bank account allegedly being [used to receive stolen funds before the money is laundered offshore.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-27/australian-businesses-used-for-scams-asic-bank-finance/103272682)

### Australian companies used to hide scammers

Australian companies are being used to shift scam victims' money overseas and it's proving a challenge for authorities trying to figure out who's responsible.

It raises serious concerns about how Australian companies are regulated, and whether weaknesses in the system are being abused by criminal networks to perpetrate fraud.

After Peter Correy reported the alleged scam, his bank managed to get two thirds of his funds back. Newtech's bank account was also shut down.

But that's when things got really weird.

False business address, false business connections and forged documents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Newtech describes itself as an "independent trader" with access to a global supply network, mainly across the oil and gas sector.

It has four directors --- 69-year-old Gold Coast-based naturopath and herbalist Geoff Beaty and three others in Europe, including Romanian Florin Rozescu.

When Newtech's bank account was shut down, its directors contacted Mr Correy to try and get it re-opened, making elaborate claims about what had happened.

The men said Newtech had received his money and sent it to accounts in Poland and Indonesia, believing that was exactly what Mr Correy wanted.

"They came back to me, completely dumbfounded as to why we would freeze the account," Mr Correy said.

"They said, 'But we've got all this signed documentation from yourself wanting to invest in Newtech.'"

![A man and a woman stroll hand in hand along a beach, the man carries a ball thrower.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f9ffc07e6f4ec8aa435a6fea4dd03b97?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=921&cropW=1382&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)

Peter and Michelle Correy assumed if Newtech had been tricked into acting as a money mule, the company would return their funds.(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)

Newtech sent the "signed documentation" to Mr Correy to see for himself. Then when he read the documents he was shocked -- he had never seen them before, and said they were forgeries.

"All [the agreements were] using our forged signatures, which they had taken from the passports that we sent through to open the account with UBS," Mr Correy said.

The men told Mr Correy that the company had received the contracts "signed by the Correy family" via a UK-based consultant named Marcel Portmann, who claimed to represent the couple.

Mr Correy said he had never heard of, or spoken to, the man named Marcel Portmann.

Amongst the documents sent to Mr Correy was:

-   A signed agreement to send $100,000 of Mr Correy's money to a Polish-Ukrainian organisation in Poland
-   A signed agreement to send $230,000 to a Hong Kong company's bank account in Indonesia to fund a Dubai development project
-   Identity documents and information purportedly from Marcel Portmann

Oddly, there was also a photo of a physical copy of the couple's home loan bank statement, a document that Mr Correy says he never sent to his scammers.

![A text message exchange between Michelle Correy and Geoff Beaty.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bd9341f523d4fe12cfee894552c27e32?src)

Michelle Correy asked Geoff Beaty how the company got a copy of the couple's bank loan statement. (Supplied)

Mr Correy assumed if both he and Newtech had been scammed, the company would simply return the rest of his money, but it refused.

Instead, Florin Rozescu encouraged Mr Correy to work with him to try to track down his money.

Mr Rozescu made an extraordinary claim that he knew people inside the international crime agency INTERPOL who could help.

"To have any possibility of return you will need to work with my contacts in Interpol," Florin Rosezcu wrote to Peter Correy on July 20, 2022.

"Interpol has stated if they are able to recover any of the funds then they must be sent back via the route that they came, so the accusation of the funds being stolen must be lifted."

This is unlikely to be true and appears to have simply been an attempt to get the account reopened.

INTERPOL's website says investigations are always carried out by national and local police forces, while the ABC has confirmed banks would not require the receiving account be open for a scam victim to get their money back.

But Newtech was adamant Mr Correy needed to help them reopen the company's CBA bank account.

Getting that bank account unfrozen seemed to be crucial to Newtech.

Mr Correy was surprised and confused to find amongst the documents the company sent to him a letter asking the CBA to reopen the account.

The letter appeared to be signed by Peter and Michelle Correy, likely using the stolen signatures copied from their passports. It included the Correys' correct home address but a false email and phone number for Peter.

It's unclear why Newtech sent the forgery to Mr Correy, or whether the company also sent it to the bank.

Mr Correy eventually decided to stop replying to the company's correspondence.

A gun shop, an accountant, but no sign of Newtech
-------------------------------------------------

Newtech describes having worldwide headquarters in Australia at a small office complex in Queensland's Gold Coast.

![A long line of small shops in a long brick building with a lawn out the front. A sign for  Sbbpartners is one of the shopfronts.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4af1ef782f1adbb51336bb0afc299b7d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1667&cropW=2500&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)

Newtech says its headquarters are located at Dominion House, in suburban Queensland, but there is no sign of the company there.(ABC News: Chris Gillette )

However, when the ABC visited the address there was no sign of the company.

In the complex, there was a gun shop and the company's former accounting firm, which confirmed Newtech had never operated an office from the location, but was a client until February 2023.

The Newtech website also describes a long history of achievements across the globe from Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Despite extensive efforts, the ABC could not independently verify the projects and deals catalogued.

A number of the company's listed partners appeared not to exist, while others denied having any connection to Newtech.

A representative from Malta Oil and Gas, which is listed as a business partner, told the ABC it "never had such a relationship with Newtech Industrial Group".

Another source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the ABC a listing which spruiks a partnership between the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Newtech and another company in 2017 was also inaccurate.

The source with knowledge of the trillion-dollar Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund's operations said there was "no connection whatsoever".

Newtech is associated with a number of companies in the United Kingdom and New Zealand which have now been dissolved, including Newtech Marketing Network (UK) Limited, Newtech Petrogas International Limited, Newtech-Acorn Petroleum Limited and Newtech Holding Group Limited.

One former business partner told the ABC they cancelled their agreement after Newtech did not deliver on its terms and it "doesn't surprise me that they are associated with failed companies".

Police find scam originated 'overseas' and Newtech director not to blame
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr Correy's case was investigated by Queensland Police but the case was dropped without charges being laid.

"She [the police officer] advised me that he [Geoff Beaty] maintained he had nothing to do with it and was told to leave it alone by his other directors," Mr Correy said.

The ABC spoke to Geoff Beaty briefly over the phone.

Mr Beaty declined to be interviewed and said:

"We were scammed, he was scammed ... there's nothing I can do about it."

When asked how his company was scammed, Mr Beaty said:

"By the people who took the money off of him, told us that it was a legitimate deal that he was involved in investing ... that's what it is.

"I'm sorry. That's enough, thank you."

Then he hung up and has not responded to written questions.

**Email <Specialist.Team@abc.net.au>**

The ABC also tracked down Hong Kong marketing company Prime Networks, where Newtech claimed some of Mr Correy's money was sent to.

Prime Network's owner, a Maltese woman named Alexandra Savvateeva, confirmed she had provided services to Newtech Industrial Group but had signed a non-disclosure agreement so could not say exactly what work was performed.

Although Prime was paid about $110,000, she said it was still owed money.

"My company has not been involved in any fraudulent transactions and has also been victimised by the actions of Newtech Industrial Group, as we have not received the full payment for the services provided," she told the ABC.

In a statement, Queensland Police said it "undertook extensive investigations" into Mr Correy's case and found Mr Correy's money had been stolen as part of "an elaborate investment fraud which originated overseas".

> "A 69-year-old Queensland man was found to also be a victim in the matter and was not involved in the fraud. The matter has been filed pending further information or evidence," Queensland Police said.

The ABC understands the 69-year-old is Geoff Beaty.

Companies being used as money mules in financial crimes
-------------------------------------------------------

Newtech Industrial Group is one of around 3.3 million companies registered in Australia.

Financial crime expert Neil Jeans worries criminal networks are abusing the company system.

![A man stands in an office with windows behind him and the Melbourne skyline in the background.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/61f693ce176fef9f889f6056fd6ac4c0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3333&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)

Neil Jeans has decades of experience investigating financial crime. He says Australia's money laundering laws are in urgent need of reform.(ABC News: Patrick Stone)

He wants the corporate regulator ASIC to be far more active in overseeing what some of those companies might be getting up to.

"ASIC is spending a significant amount of resources and effort in identifying and closing down fake websites used for scams ... why aren't they devoting equivalent resources in actually identifying fake companies that are involved in perpetrating these investment scams?" he said.

Despite Newtech's bank account being used to allegedly funnel scammed funds out of the country, the company continues to operate.

None of the foreign-based directors responded to the ABC's requests for interviews or provided a response to written questions.

"What frustrates me more than someone being arrested is that someone hasn't been made accountable," Mr Correy said.

"We were advised that ASIC wouldn't do anything about it.

"The police said, 'Look, you can report it to ASIC, but our experience is they don't do anything about these things.'"

ASIC declined to be interviewed.

In a statement it confirmed Newtech Industrial Group remained registered because it had met "administrative requirements", and said:

> "ASIC undertakes targeted surveillance to identify areas of misconduct under its jurisdiction, but is not resourced to independently verify that the 3.3 million+ companies on the companies register, and their officeholders, are not engaging in illegal activity, either under laws administered by ASIC or other regulators."

Mr Jeans believes there is more to it than resourcing.

"[I think they need] more staff, but I think it's also the will," he said.

"They actually are playing a role in, basically, allowing these schemes to exist or these or the perpetrators to use legal entities, companies, to facilitate their activity."

The Newtech case is the second incident unearthed by 730 of a legitimately-registered Australian company allegedly being used as a money mule to facilitate financial crimes.

What is a money mule?
---------------------

A money mule is a person whose account is used to transfer illegally acquired funds through the banking system and out of the reach of law enforcement.

Most money mule accounts are either created using stolen identities, or set up legitimately by people who are recruited to transfer money, move it offshore, withdraw it or convert it to cryptocurrency, usually for a commission.

Australia's money laundering watchdog AUSTRAC has warned major banks that criminals "actively exploit vulnerabilities associated with companies to launder illicit funds".

Mr Jeans said the problem was worldwide, but warned Australia remained "relatively immature" when it came to tackling it.

"Weaknesses in the system have been exploited to basically steal money from a customer and then launder the money through the Australian banking system out to the international banking system," he said.

"The criminals know where the gaps are and they will then seek to exploit them."

Mr Jeans said Australia's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws have failed to meet global obligations set by the international watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), for decades.

Under Australia's current AML/CTF regime, lawyers and accountants, who are regularly involved in processing company paperwork, are not required to report suspicious criminal activity to the authorities.

![A silhouetted man stands at a series of windows looking out over the city. He cleans his glasses.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/91c95cd9887189f05c5365de83094e4d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3333&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)

Neil Jeans has spent decades investigating financial crime. He says Australia urgently needs to widen the scope of its money laundering laws to include lawyers, accountants and real estate agents.(ABC News: Patrick Stone)

"We are one of very few countries in the world that basically have not introduced this," he said.

"It's a pretty bad fail."

The Australian government says it wants to change that but progress has been slow and it's expected to receive significant pushback from the professions involved.

### 'They didn't detect anything'

Over a four-hour phone call, scammers gained access to Jenny's computer and transferred $300,000 out of her account. By the time she alerted the bank, it was too late.  

![Jenny, dressed in a green and blue knitted top, stands in the kitchen and holds a mobile phone to her ear.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/02c24ace7329e2910be6c0b33d856366?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1001&cropW=1780&xPos=0&yPos=49&width=862&height=485)

Its first round of consultations to amend the law closed in June last year and a second round has yet to be launched.

The Attorney General Mark Dreyfus has warned about serious consequences if the country doesn't do more and is "grey listed" --- or put under increased monitoring --- by the international agency, FATF, over its anti-money laundering practices.

Last month, FATF released a report which was critical of Australia for not meeting a number of its key obligations.

"Australia is now one of only five jurisdictions out of more than 200 that do not regulate tranche-two entities [lawyers, accountants and real estate agents], placing Australia at risk of being 'grey-listed' by the FATF, which could result in significant harm to our economy," he said.

NAB's head of fraud Chris Sheehan said that criminals were exploiting new technologies, and regulators needed to do more.

"Whether the legislative and regulatory framework and environment has kept pace with those changes, I think is something that needs to be closely considered," he said.

Peter Correy said he was gutted when he realised he'd been scammed, but that his wife has stood by him during the stressful time.(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)

But for people like Peter and Michelle Correy, the consequences of the system failures are calamitous.

"I find it annoying and quite devastating that Australian companies are out there as means for channelling money overseas ... it's horrendous that this can happen."
