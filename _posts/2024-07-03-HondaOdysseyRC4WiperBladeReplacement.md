A windscreen wiper consists of three key parts:

Wiper Arm: The arm that connects the wiper blade to the wiper motor. It moves back and forth across the windscreen.

Wiper Blade: The part that directly contacts the windscreen. It is usually made of rubber or silicone.

Wiper Frame: The frame that holds the wiper blade. It can be a metal or plastic structure that provides support and distributes pressure evenly across the blade.

There is a trend to replace the windscreen wiper frame and wiper blade when it is only the rubber wiper blade that requires replacement.

Replacing the wiper frame (or wiper arm) results in uneccessary waste and cost when it comes time to replace the rubber wiper blade.

However in the case of the Honda Odyssey (Japan Model RC4 2015) in Australia it is difficult to source the rubber wiper blades.  

As an example the driver side wiper blade has a Honda part # 76622-TGA-J04 is availabe from Honda Dealership Parts Department for $25 in 2024.  However there is no aftermarket wiper blade available from autobarn.com.au , repco.com.au or supercheapauto.com.au .
