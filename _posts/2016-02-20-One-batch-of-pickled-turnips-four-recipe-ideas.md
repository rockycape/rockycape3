I love turnips and hold them with as much reverence as any vegetable. Turnips are a good demonstration of my "root to fruit" ethos as the tops are so delicious and should always be eaten. For this reason buy turnips with bright green perky leaves so that you can cook them up as a delicious free or bonus vegetable. As the leaves perish a lot quicker than the root they are also a good indication of the root's freshness. Small turnips tend to be sweeter, while larger ones have a more peppery twang. Old ones can become spongy, so choose turnips that are heavy for their size. Bag the leaves and stalks and keep these bagged in the fridge. Store the roots in the fridge separately.

**How to prepare your batch of turnips**


A classic way to cook turnips across the Middle East is pickled in vinegar with beetroot: this process turns them a shocking pink. It's also a good way to preserve a large batch. They go with just about anything, their tart-yet-sweet flavour cutting through full-flavoured and/or rich dishes.

**Makes about 750ml**

350g turnips
½ small beetroot
275ml water
100ml cider vinegar
30g salt
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp sugar
2 garlic cloves
1 bay leaf

**1** Top and tail the turnips and beetroot. Remove the skins, if they're tough. Cut into large batons. Set aside. Add the rest of the ingredients to a saucepan. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.

**2** Meanwhile, clean a jar with hot water and dry it in the oven. Fill with turnips and beetroot, top with the hot pickling liquor. Put the lid on tightly and allow to cool. These will keep in the fridge for a month.

**The raw winter salad: Wholewheat bulgur, kale, honey and turnip salad (pictured above)**
Kale and chard can be a bit tough when raw. This recipe includes a technique I learned while I was eating a lot of raw foods. Massaging the dressing into the leaves breaks them down and makes them quite delicious.

**Serves 2-4**
50g wholewheat or polished bulgur
60g kale, stalks finely cut, leaves shredded
60g chard, stalks finely cut, leaves shredded
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Juice ½ lemon
1 tbsp honey
25g cranberries or barberries
3 sprigs of dill, stalks finely cut, leaves roughly chopped
3 sprigs of mint, stalks finely cut, leaves roughly chopped
50g pickled turnips, diced

**1** Put the bulgur in a small bowl and just about cover with warm water. Put a lid on top and leave for around 30‑60 minutes to fluff up.

**2** Put the shredded kale, chard and their finely cut stalks into a bowl and pour over the lemon juice, olive oil, and a drizzle of honey. Massage the dressing into the leaves to break them down. Mix in the cooked bulgur -- which by now should be chewy and delicious -- the cranberries or barberries, the herbs with their stalks and half the pickled turnips. Sprinkle the other half of pickled turnips over the top to decorate.

**The wrap: Broad bean falafel with pickled turnips**
Pickled turnips make the perfect accompaniment to any meat or vegetarian kebab. Broad beans make a particularly nice falafel. I find them softer and more flavourful than chickpeas.

**Serves 4**
200g dried split fava beans or chickpeas, soaked in water for 6 hours
½ small onion, peeled, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
6 sprigs coriander, stalks and leaves roughly chopped
1 tsp ground cumin, toasted
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
Rapeseed or canola oil for frying
Pittas, salad (eg kofte recipe below) or coleslaw, to serve
100g pickled turnips

**1** Drain the fava beans or chickpeas, allow them to dry well, then blend to a paste along with the onion, garlic, coriander, cumin, baking powder and salt. Roll into 3cm balls and put on a tray in the fridge.

**2** Fill a small, high-sided saucepan with about 2-3cm of oil. It should be less than a third full to allow for the oil to rise when frying. Put on a medium heat. When the oil reaches 180C/350F or a small amount of the mixture floats to the top and bubbles lots, it is hot enough to begin frying. Cook the falafel in batches of 6-7 so that the oil doesn't drop too much in temperature. Turn them after a minute or two. When the falafel are nutty and brown, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon. Put in a warmed bowl.

**3** Serve in pitta or flatbread with the pickled turnips and some salad.

**The earthy supper: Lamb bacon, lentils and pickled turnips**
I first learned to make bacon at River Cottage. It's super-easy to make bacon yourself. This dry-cure method only takes five days -- it works for pork belly too. Thinly sliced lamb bacon can be fried and served with eggs for breakfast or, as here, cut into lardons and served with lentils, as below.

**Serves 4**
**For the lamb bacon**
125g coarse sea salt
50g muscovado or raw cane sugar
2 bay leaves, roughly chopped
1 sprig rosemary, picked
1 breast of lamb, deboned (boned weight about 500-600g)

**For the dish**
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
300g puy or green lentils
300ml lamb, chicken or veg stock
6 sprigs of mint, leaves and stalks finely chopped
3 sprigs of parsley, leaves and stalks finely chopped
100g pickled turnips, cut into cubes
Lamb bacon (see above)
2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted, to serve
4 poached eggs to serve (optional)

**1** First, make the lamb bacon. Mix the salt, sugar, bay leaves, and rosemary in a small bowl. Rub ⅓ of the mixture all over the lamb, making sure you get into all the hidden nooks and crannies. Reserve the rest. Place flat in a large ceramic, earthenware or plastic dish. Refrigerate, uncovered overnight.

**2** The next day, pour off any liquid. Rub on ⅓ of the remaining salt mix.

**3** Use up the rest of the mix over the next two days, each time turning the lamb belly and pouring off any excess liquid. On the fifth day, rinse off all of the salt and pat dry with a clean towel. Your lamb bacon is ready! Wrap in parchment and store in the fridge for up to two weeks.

**4** Now, make the dish. Using a sharp knife, cut the bacon in half, then slice eight thin slices of bacon from the centre and put to one side. Cut the rest of the bacon into slices then cut across into lardons about 5-10mm thick.

**5** Fry the lardons in a saucepan, stirring frequently until they are caramelised and brown. Add the crushed garlic cloves and stir. Add the lentils, stir, and add the stock, or water, bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the lentils are done -- if they run too dry, add a little extra boiling water or stock.

**6** Meanwhile, fry the slices of bacon until they are crispy, then set aside. The lentils shouldn't need any salt, because of the bacon, but add a little pepper and the herbs to finish.

**7** Serve in bowls topped with turnips, crispy pieces of bacon and a poached egg, if you wish. Finally, sprinkle with the toasted cumin seeds.

**The pink dip****: Beef kofte with turnip and yoghurt dip**  
Simple, cheap, and full of flavour. I'd recommend buying British pasture-fed, organic beef from an independent butcher as it is better for you, your community and the environment.

This dip is a very quick and easy recipe. It simply requires you to mix all the ingredients together and garnish with a few chilli flakes and sprigs of coriander. Photograph: Helen Cathcart/THE GUARDIAN

**Serves 2**
**For the kofte**
A pinch each of coriander, cumin, thyme, pepper, oregano
1 sprig of mint, stalk and leaf finely chopped
1 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp fine sea salt
200g organic beef mince
Light olive oil, for frying

**For the yoghurt and turnip dip**
50g pickled turnips
50g dates, roughly chopped
100g live yoghurt
A pinch of aleppo pepper or chilli flakes, to serve
6 whole sprigs of coriander, finely chopped

**1** To make the kofte, knead the spices, mint, lemon zest and sea salt into the mince evenly. Split; roll into four balls.

**2** To make the yoghurt and turnip dip: Mix all the ingredients together except for the aleppo pepper or chilli flakes and coriander sprigs.

**3** Roll the kofte in a little light olive oil. To cook the kofte, place a frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook until nicely charred on one side, then flip and cook for a further 2 minutes.

**4** Serve with the yoghurt and turnip dip, sprinkled with the remaining aleppo pepper or chilli flakes, and coriander sprigs.
