Step 1: Choose the safest memory stick format (most important)

Routers almost always have very limited SMB implementations. The goal is maximum compatibility, not modern features.

✅ Best choice (start here)

FAT32

Why FAT32 works best?

* Universally supported by routers

* No permissions, ownership, or case-sensitivity issues

* Simple directory structure

* Works reliably with:

  - Google TV + Kodi

  - Android VLC

  - Router-based SMB servers

Limitations (usually acceptable) - Max file size: 4 GB


Step 2: How to format the stick (MacOS Disk Utility)

On macOS:

1. Open Disk Utility

2. View → Show All Devices

3. Select the USB device (not the volume)

4. Click Erase

5. Use:

    * Format: MS-DOS (FAT)

    * Scheme: Master Boot Record (MBR)

6. Name it something simple
