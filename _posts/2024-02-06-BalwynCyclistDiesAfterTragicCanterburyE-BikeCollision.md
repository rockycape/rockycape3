A Balwyn e-cyclist has died in hospital following a horror collision with another rider in late January.

Nitin Prabhu, 41, died on February 6, just a week after colliding with another cyclist on Mont Albert Rd in Canterbury.

He was rushed to hospital after the collision on January 29.

The other rider, a 62-year-old Blackburn man, suffered minor injuries and was also taken to hospital.

A fundraiser for Mr Prabhu's family had raised $37,937 by 11am on February 6.

Creator of the fundraiser and friend of Mr Prabhu, Suneeth Umesh Rao, said his friend left behind "a legacy of kindness and a warmth".

"Nitin's life was a testament to the power of unity and compassion," he said.

"He profoundly touched us all."

Emergency services were called to the incident on Mont Albert Rd on January 29 at 6.35pm after two men on e-bikes had collided.

A paramedic crew and police attended the scene.

An Ambulance Victoria spokesperson said a 41-year-old Balwyn man had been taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with life-threatening injuries to his upper body.

The second rider, a 62-year-old Blackburn man, was also taken to hospital with minor injuries.

A Victoria Police spokesperson said Nunawading highway patrol officers were investigating the incident.

The investigation remains ongoing.

Anyone with information or dashcam footage of the incident is urged to contact Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000 or make an anonymous online report here.
