## In short:

A series of cyber attacks on defence supply chain contractors has compromised material relating to Australia's weapons programs.

Information relating to the ADF's $7 billion Redback infantry fighting vehicle contract was among the details allegedly leaked.

## What's next?

Cybersecurity analysts say the incidents are a wake-up call as hackers seek to exploit the defence industry's weakest links.

A series of cyber attacks on defence industry supply chain contractors has exposed threats to Australia's weapons programs, security analysts say.

Over the past week, it was revealed that a hacker group shared material about Australia's $7 billion Land 400 military program after allegedly breaching several Israeli defence companies.

The Cyber Toufan group posted images and details on Telegram about the Australian Defence Force's (ADF) next-generation Redback infantry fighting vehicle.

Another group claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on IKAD Engineering, a key player in the Australian defence industry.

The J Group ransomware gang alleges it infiltrated the company's systems for five months in what it described as a "staycation in the defence supply chain".

The hackers claimed they obtained information relating to Australian naval contracts, including the [Hunter Class frigate](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/israeli-weapons-company-awarded-australian-army-contract/103519558) and Collins Class submarine programs.

IKAD Engineering chief executive Gerard Dyson confirmed the incident, saying an "external third party" had gained unauthorised access to a portion of its internal IT systems.

He said so far only "non-sensitive project information" had been impacted, along with employee files.

Cybersecurity experts warned even non-sensitive data could have strategic value, and the attacks should be a "wake-up call".

## Hackers 'at home' in defence systems

Ethical hacker Jamieson O'Reilly, founder of information security company Dvuln, said J Group's intrusion into IKAD Engineering's systems had "generated substantial concern within the defence and cybersecurity sectors".

"For the Australian defence ecosystem, the IKAD incident functions as a case study in supply chain exposure," Mr O'Reilly told the ABC.

> "Adversaries actively seek the weakest link in a chain rather than the most prominent organisation."

In a post to its dark web blog, J Group described IKAD Engineering as an "Australian firm that plays with some very big, expensive toys for the defence industry".

The hackers claimed they infiltrated the systems for more than five months after initially gaining access through a vulnerability in an older VPN application.

J Group said the "staycation" allowed them to allegedly exfiltrate 800 GB of data in a "masterclass in supply chain risk".

"We didn't rush, we didn't smash grab. We set up tools, moved laterally, dumped hashes, and just … lived there. For five months," the hackers said.

> "We felt more at home on their network than they probably did."

Rahat Masood, a senior lecturer at UNSW's School of Computer Science and Engineering, described the technique as "data exfiltration".

"Their purpose is to actually move the data from the network to another location and then encrypt it," Dr Masood said.

"They clear the logs as well. There is no way to find out how long they had access and what they were doing in the network for the past five months."

J Group boasted that after "150 days of uninterrupted access" they could "curate a museum of corporate secrets".

"We have the complete unedited tender responses for some of the biggest defence projects in the region," they claimed.

## Australian program details leaked

A similar tactic was allegedly carried out by Cyber Toufan.

The group claims to have hacked 17 Israeli defence contractors after spending a prolonged period of time infiltrating supply chain company MAYA Technologies.

"One and a half years after gaining full access to the network, we have explored every part of it," the group posted on its blog on October 30.

"Through the systems, we have breached Elbit and Rafael's through then \[sic\]."

The group boasted about allegedly obtaining "tens of terabytes" of data and technical documents, including details about Israel's [Iron Dome and Laser Dome](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-17/inside-israels-iron-dome-davids-sling-and-arrow-air-defence/105420744) air defence systems.

Images and 3D renderings purporting to show parts from Australia's Redback infantry fighting vehicles were among the series of leaks posted to Cyber Toufan's Telegram channels this month.

Retired Major General Marcus Thompson, who used to lead the Department of Defence's Information Warfare Division, said the breach was concerning.

"There are aspects of the Redback vehicle that the Australian Army wouldn't want known publicly, or certainly not known to a potential adversary," he told the ABC.

The ADF contracted Hanwha Defence Australia to deliver and support 129 locally-built Redback infantry fighting vehicles to replace the aging M113AS4 armoured personnel carriers.

Hanwha Defence Australia was unable to comment on the incident as the investigation was ongoing.

Elbit Systems said it received information that a "contractor for mechanical parts" was targeted in a cyber attack.

"Based on our initial assessment, no classified security materials have been compromised," Elbit Systems said in a statement to the ABC.

> "As a general rule, this contractor does not hold critical information."

The company denied claims that Elbit networks or systems were breached, adding that it was "conducting a thorough investigation".

## Non-sensitive data has 'strategic value'

Mr O'Reilly said it was important not to underestimate how all types of data could be used against organisations.

"Smaller engineering firms often provide specialised services and hold sensitive operational context even if they do not handle classified technical data," he said.

After conducting a threat intelligence review of the IKAD Engineering breach, Mr O'Reilly said the scale was "significant".

His organisation did not download the dark web files, but it was able to understand the scale and nature of the breach by examining the directory structures, filenames and metadata exposed on J Group's distribution platform.

"The listing includes more than 28,000 email files, hundreds of scanned identity documents and a very large collection of HR and process material," he said.

Dvuln found about 70 filenames [referencing submarines or submarine programs](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-13/defence-admits-hunter-class-frigates-poor-process/103098592), often in the context of expressions of interest, tenders or project-related correspondence.

Although the information could technically be classed as "non sensitive" as IKAD assessed, Mr O'Reilly noted that the "distinction should not lead to complacency".

"When an adversary compromises a supplier, they gain access to the language, patterns and relationships that connect organisations across the supply chain," he said.

"That information can be used to build credible approaches to higher-tier targets. This is why contextual data, even when not formally classified, has strategic value."

IKAD said the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Australian Federal Police, and the Defence Industry Security Program had been notified.

The ABC contacted the Defence Department for comment.

## ASIO warns of state-backed threats

The cyber attacks come after repeated warnings from ASIO director-general Mike Burgess that Australia's defence industry was facing an intensified espionage threat.

"Multiple countries are relentlessly seeking information about our military capabilities," he said in a security assessment earlier this year.

At a business forum in Melbourne last week, Mr Burgess specifically accused "Chinese hackers" of [seeking to gain access to critical infrastructure assets.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-12/spy-chief-warns-of-china-espionage-threat-to-business/105999522)

China dismissed the claim, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying that Mr Burgess's remarks "spread false narratives and deliberately provoked confrontation".

Katherine Mansted, executive director of cyber intelligence at CyberCX, said it was "quite likely" that Cyber Toufan had links to Iran.

The group emerged in November 2023, and are known to predominantly target Israeli organisations.

Cybersecurity analysts say the scale and tactics of its operations bear the hallmarks of a potentially state-sponsored entity.

"Cyber Toufan is part of what is a relatively new phenomenon in this kind of scene, which is the growth of hacktivist groups," Ms Mansted told the ABC.

"Many of these groups are non-state, but many of them are also backed by foreign governments."

After growing in prominence at the outset of the full-scale Ukraine conflict, many hacktivists pivoted to focusing on Israel-Hamas issues.

Rather than seeking a ransom, they often engage in disruption attacks or release sensitive information to embarrass targets or even impact the course of a conflict.

Ms Mansted said the rise of hacktivists was very much a global phenomenon with many targeting Australian interests.

"They sometimes affect Australia through the supply chain nexus, like in the Cyber Toufan case … that was kind of two hops removed from defence," she said.

> "But we see groups actively targeting Australian organisations, government and private sector as well."

Retired Major General Thompson said it was clear more needed to be done to ensure defence supply chains were secure because "you're only as strong as your weakest link".

"It's a concern, quite frankly … Defence should really be holding their contractors' feet to the fire," he said.

"Every organisation in the supply chain for the Australian Defence Force should be thinking about their cybersecurity so that they're not only defending themselves, but they're defending their customer, i.e, the soldiers, the sailors, and the aviators who will ultimately have to go into harm's way."
