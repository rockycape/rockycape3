Earlier today, I saw an interesting post from a friend of mine on my personal FB. Very intelligent woman, very strong principles but not a politics junkie. And that post was disinformation. 
HOW DID I KNOW?
I mean, yeah, I study this stuff and wrote a book about it AND I live on the internet BUT ALSO there were some clues that *anyone* can pick up if they know what to look for.
1.) it said "don't share this post, copy and paste it"
... so I knew it hadn't really come from my friend. It had come from a disinformation source. The reason they want you to copy and paste the content is a) to obscure who actually wrote it and b) because if it comes from someone you know, you'll probably believe it (these are called 'credibility cues' and someone you know is always the most powerful source of credibility). 
SO BE AWARE ANYONE ASKING YOU TO DO THIS HAS PROBABLY BEEN ROPED INTO A DISINFORMATION PIPELINE. 
Do **not** trust the content - and CALL your friend who shared it in the first place , in person, and have a super respectful word, let them know what they're sharing BECAUSE THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO KNOW.
 Be WAY SENSITIVE to the fact that noone likes to be manipulated so don't publish anything in public that says HEY THIS IS PROPAGANDA, be kind.
2.) it made ENRAGING claims about politicians, but not with any links to verifiable news outlets or to primary sources (statements from politicians, media releases on their websites, etc). The post attacked Australian senators for claiming special "pollie" pensions and for having super-special healthcare arrangements.
THERE HASN'T BEEN A FEDERAL POLLIE PENSION SINCE 2004*. 
THERE ARE NO SPECIAL HEALTHCARE ARRANGEMENTS. 
AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLITICIANS ARE COVERED BY THE SAME HEALTH SYSTEM AS THE REST OF US.
NOONE IS COMING TO TAKE YOUR GRAN'S SENIORS BUS PASS.
I asked my friend if she realised that there was no special healthcare system for politicians, and she said she read the claim and didn't believe it but because the original post had come from a friend of hers, she thought her friend might know something she didn't. 
See how this works? CREDIBILITY CUES FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW... when the original source could be *literally anyone, anywhere*.
In the case of what my friend shared, it probably originally came from America, and was run through an AI programme to make it sound like it was Australian. I suspected this because a.) there was a bit *too much* Australian slang than you'd expect from any genuine local poster and b.) politicians in the American Congress *do* have their own special healthcare coverage. 
Why do they post these lies? BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ADVERTISING WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY OR THEY'RE FRIGHTENED. I am, you are, everyone is. 
If something makes you angry or frightened on the internet it's because it wants to *sell you something* - it might be a hat, or a magic bean machine, or a *dangerous* politician. The post is designed to soften you up for the sale.
Delete the post, make yourself a cool glass of water and - as the kids say - "touch grass" for ten minutes. 
If you do not know something is a solid fact, and you only have your mate's word for it, DO NOT SHARE IT, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TRUE.
If you do not have time to rigorously fact-check something that appears without sources - congratulations! Your life is full, hooray! JUST REMEMBER: if you aren't going to search *real* newspapers, go to politicians' websites, check the parliamentary record, DO NOT SHARE IT, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TRUE.
Lies and disinformation are how EXTREMELY DANGEROUS people who do NOT have your best interests at heart get into power and then do *genuinely* outrageous things. 
The best self-defence weapon you have in a democracy is a rigorous relationship with facts. 
AI has made it incredibly easy to automate propaganda (I'll give you an example below). In the lead up to potentially life-changing elections in Australia and across the world, DO NOT FALL FOR IT like sooooo many Americans did. 
Simple ways to stay informed of *facts* in the Australian context:
- subscribe to the AAP and Reuters mailing lists; these are genuinely independent news reporting services
- read the Guardian online AND the Nine/Fairfax papers - they take editorial positions, but as one is centre-left and the other is centre-right, you'll get a SPECTRUM of analysis on Australian politics
- listen to ABC radio and watch ABC and SBS news. Even for 10 minutes a day.  
- double-check with primary sources (if you can't find where it came straight from the horse's mouth, the horse probably didn't say it)
If you think something seems a bit "off" online, you can run it through a free online app like GPTZero, which analyses how likely it is something has been written by AI. 
And remember: ANYTHING on the internet that sounds too good to be true - or too BAD to be true -  probably IS NOT TRUE.
I love you all.

*As the "pollie pension" was only removed for MPs elected to federal parliament AFTER 2004, there are (by my research) only 4 of the current 227 members of the parliament who will receive it, as they've been in parliament longer than 21 years. If my research is wrong, let me know.
