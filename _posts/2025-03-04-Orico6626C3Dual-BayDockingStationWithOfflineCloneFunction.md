The ORICO 6626C3 is a dual-bay docking station compatible with 2.5" and 3.5" SATA HDDs and SSDs. It offers both standard PC connectivity and an offline cloning function, allowing duplication of data from one drive to another without the need for a computer.

**Using the Docking Station with a Computer (PC Mode):**

1. **Insert the Hard Drives:**
    
    - Align your 2.5" or 3.5" SATA HDD/SSD with the slots on the docking station.
    - Gently insert the drives vertically into the bays, ensuring they're fully seated.
2. **Connect to Power and Computer:**
    
    - Attach the provided power adapter to the docking station and plug it into a power outlet.
    - Use the included USB data cable to connect the docking station to your computer.
3. **Power On:**
    
    - Press the power switch located at the back of the docking station. The LED indicators should light up, signaling a successful connection.
4. **Access the Drives:**
    
    - On your computer, open "My Computer" or "This PC" to access the connected drives.
    - If the drives are new and unformatted, you'll need to initialize and partition them:
        - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Manage."
        - Navigate to "Disk Management."
        - Locate your new drive, right-click, and choose "Initialize Disk."
        - After initialization, create a new partition and format it as needed.

**Performing Offline Cloning (Clone Mode):**

1. **Prepare the Drives:**
    
    - Insert the **Source Disk** (the drive containing the data to be copied) into the Source bay (typically labeled "A").
    - Insert the **Target Disk** (the drive to which the data will be copied) into the Target bay (typically labeled "B"). Ensure the Target Disk has equal or larger capacity than the Source Disk.
2. **Set to Clone Mode:**
    
    - Move the mode switch on the docking station to the "CLONE" position.
3. **Initiate Cloning:**
    
    - Press and hold the "START" button for 3-5 seconds until the HDD2 LED indicator turns off.
    - Within 5 seconds, press the "START" button again to begin the cloning process.
4. **Monitor Progress:**
    
    - The LED indicators will light up sequentially, showing progress at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
    - Once all four LEDs are solidly lit, the cloning process is complete.
5. **Completion:**
    
    - Turn off the power switch and remove both drives. The Target Disk now contains the cloned data.

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure correct placement of Source and Target disks to prevent accidental data loss.
- The Target Disk's capacity must be equal to or greater than the Source Disk's capacity.
- Avoid powering off or removing drives during operations to prevent data corruption.
- The docking station has an automatic sleep function after 5 minutes of inactivity. Click the drive letter to wake it up.
