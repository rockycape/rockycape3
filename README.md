Since 2020, GitHub Pages has introduced several updates and requirements that should be considered for maintaining compatibility:

* Use the latest version of Jekyll and its dependencies to avoid deprecated features and ensure security patches are applied.
* GitHub Actions can now be used to automate the build and deployment process, providing more control and customization.
* Ensure your repository adheres to the storage and bandwidth limits set by GitHub Pages, and consider using a CDN if needed.
* Enabling HTTPS is recommended to secure your site and redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

**Analysis of the Codebase**

The repository primarily consists of HTML and Ruby files, with a significant focus on a Jekyll-based static site. The index.html file uses a simple layout directive to leverage Jekyll's templating engine. The _config.yml file is well-structured, including various site settings, build configurations, and plugin integrations. This setup ensures efficient static site generation and easy customization, making it suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages. The configuration supports pagination, sitemap generation, and social media integration, enhancing the site's functionality and user experience.
